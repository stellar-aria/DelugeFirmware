// Registered by C++ at sample-load (`deluge_streaming_define_asset()`/`SampleStream::open_read_stream()`,
// see `chunk_residency.cpp`/`sample_stream.cpp`);
// read by the native fill task via [`fill_context_for`] (`prod::ProdOps::begin`/`finish`, SR2d-4
// Task 5). See `include/libdeluge/streaming_fill.h`'s doc for the C-side contract.

/// Fixed capacity for the per-asset fill-context table, keyed by asset id. Mirrors `kAssetCap`
/// (`general_memory_allocator.cpp`) — the resource manager's asset-table capacity — so every asset
/// id the manager can ever hand out has a slot here. A plain literal, not read from the C++ side (the
/// two are kept in sync by hand); if `kAssetCap` is ever raised, raise this too. A `DELUGE_RESOURCE_NO_ASSET`
/// (`u32::MAX`) id is naturally rejected by the same bounds check as any other out-of-range id.
///
/// At this size (4096 × 32 bytes = 128 KiB) the table does NOT fit in on-chip SRAM at debug
/// opt-levels — measured: `cargo device`'s `dev`-profile link failed with the SRAM region
/// overflowing (a `.bss` placement here pushed `.ARM.exidx` past the RTT reservation), while the
/// SAME table built clean under `--release` (see `linker/memory_rtt.x`'s own "a large live feature
/// ... needs [release-like density] to fit at debug opt-levels" caveat — this table just measurably
/// hit that ceiling too). Rather than shrink the table below a size that would make it useless for
/// real per-asset coverage, [`FILL_CONTEXTS`] is placed in SDRAM instead (`.sdram_bss`, 64 MiB, a
/// rounding error at this size) on device — the same fix already used for `fiber::WORKER_STACK`,
