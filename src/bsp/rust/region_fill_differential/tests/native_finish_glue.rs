//! SR2d-4 Task 6's cross-path/single-store regression: the ONE test the whole-branch review said
//! was missing (`progress.md`'s "GATE-GAP LEARNING") — every OTHER host gate exercises either
//! `fill_logic::finish_convert_stitch` in isolation (over hand-built plain buffers — `differential.rs`,
//! `tests/fill_logic_host.rs`) or `streaming_loader::fill_once`/`FillOps` against a fully FAKE
//! `FillOps` (`tests/streaming_fill_host.rs`, in `deluge-bsp-rust`), or `ProdOps::begin`/`finish`'s
//! ORCHESTRATION only, with plain local `ConvertState` values standing in for the real store
//! (`tests/host_end_to_end.rs`, this crate). None of them drive
//! `deluge_sample_fill::native_finish` itself — its `try_acquire` → payload-accessor →
//! convert-state-accessor → stitch → write-back chain — over the REAL streamed-chunk accessors.
//! That gap is exactly where SR2d-4's Task 2 review found TWO real, silent-corruption Criticals (see
//! `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`'s "SR2d-4-UNIFY execution"):
//!
//!  1. **The convert-state double-store**: before this arc's unification (commits c8be0f8ae..66e584de2),
//!     the synchronous C++ fill path (`read_cluster_data` → `finish_fill`) wrote convert-state directly
//!     onto the chunk, while the async Rust fill task wrote a SEPARATE Rust-side sidecar table — two
//!     disjoint stores. A boundary stitch between a sync-loaded cluster and an async-prefetched
//!     neighbour read the EMPTY store, corrupting the boundary silently on every affected note.
//!     Structurally fixed by routing BOTH paths through `native_finish` over the ONE chunk accessor
//!     store (`deluge_streaming_chunk_convert_state`/`_set_convert_state`) — this test proves that
//!     unification actually holds by driving what were the "two paths" (two separate `finish` calls,
//!     mirroring a sync-loaded neighbour and an async-loaded self) through the SAME real store and
//!     confirming the second call reads the first's write-back, not a zeroed default.
//!  2. **Backing-vs-payload** (commit 9585be616): `native_finish` built each neighbour's payload slice
//!     directly from the raw `try_acquire` pointer (the chunk's BACKING) instead of
//!     `deluge_streaming_chunk_payload(p)` (`backing + kChunkPayloadOffset`, the chunk's PAYLOAD) — the
//!     neighbour stitch read/wrote the neighbour's header bytes instead of its samples.
//!
//! ## How this test drives the REAL glue
//!
//! `native_finish`/`native_begin` (SR2d-4 Tasks 2-5) moved out of `deluge-bsp-rust`'s
//! `streaming_loader.rs::prod` module into the shared `deluge_sample_fill` crate (C2a Task 3), `pub`
//! and behind that crate's `native_fill` feature (this crate's `Cargo.toml` turns it on as a
//! dev-dependency). So this test calls `deluge_sample_fill::native_begin`/`native_finish` directly —
//! no more `#[path]`-recompiling `deluge-bsp-rust`'s `streaming_loader.rs`/`fill_logic.rs`, no more
//! `ProdOps`/`FillOps` indirection. Driving `deluge_sample_fill::native_finish(chunk, true)` directly
//! IS driving the real function — the same one `deluge-bsp-rust`'s `ProdOps::finish` (a one-line call
//! straight into it) and the strong `deluge_streaming_finish_fill` C-ABI override both call.
//!
//! `deluge_sample_fill::native`'s `unsafe extern "C"` block (gated `native_fill`) declares 9 symbols
//! this test must supply. Four (`deluge_resource_chunk_ident`, `_try_acquire`, `_release`,
//! `_mark_ready`) are real `#[no_mangle]` Rust symbols from the `deluge_resource` crate (already a
//! dev-dependency) — genuinely real, no test double. **U4d relocated the streamed chunk's storage
//! (construct + the seven field accessors) out of C++ entirely, into this same `deluge_sample_fill`
//! crate** (`chunk.rs`) — so the four remaining accessors (`chunk::payload`/`set_loaded`/
//! `convert_state`/`set_convert_state`, plain `pub fn`s since U4d Task 8 deleted their `#[no_mangle]`
//! C-ABI wrappers) are now ALSO real, no-test-double calls, satisfied by `deluge_sample_fill`'s own
//! object code (this crate already depends on it). Before U4d this file `cc`-compiled a small C++ slice
//! (`cpp/native_finish_shim.cpp`) that re-stated those four accessor bodies verbatim over a real,
//! placement-new'd C++ `StreamedChunk` — that struct (and the shim) no longer exist; U4d Task 3
//! retired both, since redefining the same four symbols here now would be a link-time duplicate
//! against `deluge_sample_fill`'s own copies, not a meaningful test double.
//!
//! The ONE symbol this test still has to provide by hand is `deluge_streaming_resource_manager`
//! (below) — NOT part of either Critical's bug surface (both bugs were in `native_finish`'s own
//! neighbour-payload/convert-state wiring, not in "which manager is the global one"); real
//! production code resolves it via `GeneralMemoryAllocator::get().resourceManager()`, which this
//! host test doesn't compile, so it stands in with a plain `AtomicPtr` set by [`ChunkHarness::new`] —
//! the same test-local tier `tests/host_end_to_end.rs` already uses for its own
//! `ENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION`/`EXIT_CRITICAL_SECTION`/`deluge_in_interrupt`.
//!
//! Chunk construction goes straight through `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::deluge_streaming_chunk_construct`
//! too (via [`construct_streamed_chunk`], a thin signature-matching wrapper — see its own doc for why
//! it needs to exist at all) — the SAME callback the resource manager invokes for a real streamed
//! SAMPLE chunk in production (`chunk_residency.cpp`), not a hand-rolled stand-in.
//!
//! ## What this test does NOT exercise
//!
//! - `native_begin` (the sector/byte-offset descriptor arithmetic) — untouched by either Critical
//!   (both were `finish`-side), already covered byte-identically by `fill_logic_host.rs`'s `begin`
//!   tests and `differential.rs`. This test seeds each chunk's payload directly, mirroring "the read
//!   already completed".
//! - `Sample`/`SampleStream`, or `GeneralMemoryAllocator` — this test never touches the app's
//!   storage/model closure; only the relocated Rust chunk + the shared resource manager.
//! - The efatfs read (`ProdOps::read`, in `deluge-bsp-rust`) — this test never calls it; covered
//!   elsewhere (`fs_differential`, `streaming_fill_host.rs`'s descriptor-plumbing test).
//! - On-device timing/DMA — this is a host, single-threaded, synchronous exercise of the same calls
//!   the async task and the sync fill path make; the real hardware validation is Kate's on-device gate
//!   (non-native-format playback across note-on/seek/loop — see the task brief).
//!
//! ## Teeth: this test was verified (by hand, outside the committed suite) to FAIL on both Criticals
//!
//! Both original bugs were reintroduced locally against this exact test (one at a time, `git
//! checkout`-restored immediately after) and the failure output captured — see the Task 6 report for
//! the exact diffs and failure text. The mechanism each perturbation breaks:
//! - **Backing-vs-payload**: [`CLUSTER_SIZE`] is chosen so `CLUSTER_SIZE + 7` lands STRICTLY between
//!   `size_of::<StreamedChunk>()` and the payload offset (see [`geometry_and_layout_invariants_hold`]) —
//!   a neighbour-payload read/write from the raw backing pointer instead of the payload accessor would
//!   read/corrupt the struct's own fields and the unnamed front-guard padding, never reaching the real
//!   seeded payload ramp at all, so the stitched output diverges from the C++ reference immediately.
//! - **Double-store**: the single-visit boundaries alone (prev/next both fresh, each visited exactly
//!   once by self) turned out NOT to have teeth for this class by themselves — `stitch_next`/
//!   `stitch_prev`'s "already converted?" branch (`stitch.cpp`) is false on every first visit
//!   regardless of which store answered it, so a neighbour-state read landing on a zeroed default
//!   happens to coincide with the correct "never touched" value there (verified empirically: the
//!   naive version of this test, checking only the single-visit boundaries plus a bare post-hoc
//!   convert-state readback, still PASSED with the double-store bug reintroduced). The part of
//!   `cross_path_finish_matches_cpp_reference_over_real_streamed_chunks` that actually has teeth is
//!   its second act: PREV gets overwritten with fresh bytes ("reloaded") and re-`finish`ed, now with
//!   SELF as its ready NEXT — since self's start_converted is TRUE by then (set by self's own
//!   `finish` above), prev's reload must read that true value back through the SAME store to
//!   correctly take the "already converted" branch (which stages the recompute from self's captured
//!   `unconverted_head`, not its current payload) — a disjoint/empty second store answers false
//!   instead, taking the wrong branch and producing concretely different bytes in prev's reloaded
//!   payload. [`neighbour_convert_state_is_read_back_through_the_shared_store`] complements this by
//!   proving the WRITE side (the flags really do land in the shared store, non-default), but the
//!   reload re-`finish` is what proves the READ side actually depends on it.
