///        (golden_vt_render's `GOLDEN_SCENARIO=recorder_roundtrip` mode).
///
/// The whole geometry matrix + alterFile characterization + the two readback probes, minus the
/// host-side image formatting and process exit (the caller owns those). Assumes `DELUGE_SD_IMAGE`
/// is already mounted (boot mounts it). Reads back through `deluge::io::File` (drain-independent)
/// except the `finalized_multicluster` probe, whose fill drain routes unconditionally onto
/// `deluge_streaming_drain_queue_blocking()` (the async fill task) — see `recorder_readback_probe.cpp`.
///
/// @note `DELUGE_HOST`-only, compiled into `deluge_app` (the harness dir is globbed in), so the
///       Embassy binary — which links `deluge_app`, not `host_recorder_roundtrip_main.cpp` — can
