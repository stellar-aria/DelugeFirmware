//! The Rust async cluster-fill task and its BSP wiring: drains the resource
//! manager's loader queue (`deluge_resource_loader_next`) on the same
//! thread-mode Embassy executor the fiber pump and the C++ enqueue path run on,
//! awaiting the actual SD read instead of running it synchronously inline.
//!
//! ## Two compilation tiers
//!
//! This module compiles in two tiers, because the selector the C++ side calls
//! (`deluge_streaming_async_active`) must resolve on the Embassy BSP regardless
//! of whether the async backing is actually enabled — a cargo feature can't
//! reach a C++ `#define`, so "is the async task active" has to be a runtime
//! call, and that call needs a real symbol to link against either way:
//!
//! - Always compiled whenever this module is (i.e. on the Embassy BSP, device
//!   or `host_app` — see the `mod streaming_loader;` cfg in `main.rs`), no
//!   matter the `async_streaming_loader` feature: [`FILL_WAKE`], the two
//!   `extern "C"` selector/wakeup functions just below it
//!   (`deluge_streaming_async_active`, `deluge_streaming_signal_fill`), and the
//!   per-asset fill-context table (`deluge_streaming_set_fill_context`,
//!   [`fill_context_for`]) — asset definition, which registers it, happens on
//!   every BSP at sample-load, not just the ones with the async fill task
//!   built in. Every other BSP/config (legacy/host-cooperative sim, rza1)
//!   never links this crate at all; the `__attribute__((weak))` C++ fallbacks
//!   in `async_fill.cpp` resolve there instead.
//! - Feature-gated behind `async_streaming_loader`: the actual drain machinery
//!   ([`FillOps`], [`fill_once`], [`ProdOps`], [`streaming_fill_task`]). Spawned
//!   in `main.rs` (device `main` + host `host_app`) only under that feature.
//!
//! ## Why the drain loop is generic over [`FillOps`]
//!
//! Constructing a real `StreamedChunk`/`SampleStream`/`Sample` plus a seeded
//! resource manager inside a Rust host test is impractical, and mocking the
//! `#[no_mangle]` C symbols below would collide with the real ones whenever this
//! crate also links the C++ app (`host_app`). So the orchestration itself
//! ([`fill_once`]) takes its four operations — `next`/`begin`/`read`/`finish` (plus
//! the failure-path re-enqueue) — through the [`FillOps`] trait instead of calling
//! the `extern "C"` functions directly. [`ProdOps`] below wires that trait to the
//! real C ABI + the efatfs streaming read (`crate::efatfs_fs`/`crate::efatfs_host_shim`); the
//! host unit test
//! (`tests/streaming_fill_host.rs`) wires it to an in-memory fake queue instead.
//! This is the whole reason [`fill_once`] is independently testable — the real
//! end-to-end fill (real manager, real chunks) is validated separately, via a
//! ThreadSanitizer check and a full scenario harness.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! The manager (`DelugeResource*`) is `!Send`/`!Sync` by design — single-executor
//! only. [`streaming_fill_task`] and the C++ enqueue path (the CLUSTER_ENQUEUE
//! sites in `sample_stream.cpp`) both run on the one thread-mode Embassy
//! executor the whole app runs on, so the raw
//! pointer never needs to (and must never) cross threads.
