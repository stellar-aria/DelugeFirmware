//! The passive lookahead reservation handle (`include/libdeluge/sample_reader.h`'s
//! `DelugeSampleReservation`/`deluge_sample_reserve_open`/`_close`) — the ACTIVE twin of
//! [`crate::reader::peek`]. Where a peek is a single, transient, non-pinning glance at whatever is
//! already resident, a reservation pins a small forward- or backward-facing WINDOW of cluster
//! residency (one real `deluge_resource::facade::Lease` per covered cluster) for as long as it
//! stays open — the same shape the existing `kNumClustersLoadedAhead` (`definitions_cxx.hpp`)
//! lookahead pins already give the timestretch/loop-point paths, generalized behind this crate's
//! own C-ABI handle.
//!
//! `open`/`close`/`covered_indices` provide the coverage + lease accounting.
//! [`Reservation::reanchor`] slides the window as playback advances, guarded against
//! per-render-tick lease churn when the marker drifts within its current head cluster.
//! Synchronous load-now materialization for [`LoadMode::Now`]/[`LoadMode::NowOrEnqueue`] is
