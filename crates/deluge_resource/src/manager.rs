//! The resource manager core — a value-scored, lease-based cache of reconstructable
//! assets, layered on the `deluge_alloc` TLSF heap. See docs/dev/resource_manager.md.
//!
//! Model: **Asset** (identity + a `Source` recipe + soft references) → **Chunk**
//! (the resident, individually-leased/evicted unit). Both live in fixed-capacity
//! tables allocated once from the heap.
//!
//! **Safe core, thin `unsafe` shell.** The tables are `&'static [Cell<Slot>]` of
//! `Copy` PODs, accessed by index — so all the bookkeeping (lease accounting, the
//! value function, eviction selection) is *safe* Rust. `Cell` gives interior
//! mutability with no borrow to invalidate, which is exactly what makes the manager
//! reentrancy-tolerant: when an allocation drives the reclaim hook, that hook takes
//! another shared `&Manager` and mutates through `Cell` — sound, because no method
//! ever takes `&mut self`. The manager never dereferences a chunk's backing memory
//! (it only stores it and passes it to `materialize` / `deluge_free`), so the only
//! `unsafe` is at the edges: the FFI entry points, the one-time table setup over the
//! heap bytes, the `materialize`/`on_evict` fn-pointer calls, and the alloc/free calls.
