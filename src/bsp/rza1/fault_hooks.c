/// `libdeluge/fault.h` for this board — the RZ/A1 half of the pad-grid crash reporter.
///
/// The pattern itself moved to the portable application
/// (`src/deluge/io/debug/fault_pattern.c`) so the Rust/Embassy BSP gets the same crash
/// display; this file is what remains board-specific, and is the transport that
/// renderer used to inline. Behaviour is unchanged: bytes go into the PIC UART's TX
/// ring through the uncached mirror, then the existing DMA flush pushes them out.
