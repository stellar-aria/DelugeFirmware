//! SP1a Task 2: the single-owner mounted `embedded-fatfs` `FileSystem` —
//! mounts ONE `FileSystem` over the real SD card (`SdBlockDevice`, see
//! `fat_block_device.rs`) and stores it behind an `embassy_sync` async
//! `Mutex`. [`with_fs`] is the ONLY way live code may touch the FS.
//!
//! embedded-fatfs's `FileSystem` wraps its disk in a `RefCell`, which assumes
//! *exclusive* (non-reentrant, non-concurrent) access — two fibers/tasks
//! calling into it at once would panic the `RefCell` (or worse, race the
//! underlying SD transfer). An async `Mutex` (not the `RefCell` itself, and
//! not a blocking lock) serializes all FS operations here while letting a
//! holder `.await` (yield the executor) across the underlying SD transfer,
//! rather than busy-spinning or blocking other tasks outright.
//!
//! Device-only and flag-gated: nothing in this module is called yet. The
//! file-handle table (Task 3), the FFI boundary (Task 4), and the read-path
//! swap (Task 5/6) are what actually invoke [`mount`]/[`with_fs`] — until
//! then this module is dead code by design, hence the blanket
//! `#![allow(dead_code)]` below (keeps the `efatfs_streaming` build
//! warning-clean without disturbing the default build, which doesn't compile
//! this file at all).
