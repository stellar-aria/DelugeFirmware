//! Compiles `cpp/harness_shim.cpp` (SR2d-4 Task 6's C++ fill-differential reference slice) into this
//! crate's Rust test binary via `cc::Build`, so the differential can drive the real
//! `convert_cluster_data`/`stitch_boundaries` orchestration over FFI. Host-only, x86-64: this crate is
//! a test harness, never linked into the firmware, so (unlike `sample_convert`'s build.rs) there is no
//! device path and no armv7a-NEON compile-and-verify step.
//!
//! ## Only ONE translation unit compiled here — deliberately
//!
//! `harness_shim.cpp` `#include`s `convert.h`/`stitch.h` directly (same headers `sample_convert`'s own
//! `cpp/shim.cpp` includes), but this build script does NOT also compile
//! `convert.cpp`/`stitch.cpp`/`util/audio_format_helpers.cpp` the way `sample_convert`'s build.rs does.
//! `convert_cluster_data` is a TEMPLATE (header-only, in `convert.h`) — this TU's instantiation of it
//! compiles straight into `harness_shim.cpp.o` with no external symbol needed. `stitch_boundaries` (a
//! plain, non-template function declared in `stitch.h`, defined in `stitch.cpp`) and the internal
//! `convert_word` the template's `convert_word_in_place` calls (declared in `convert.h`, defined in
//! `convert.cpp`) are left UNDEFINED in this archive on purpose: this crate depends on
//! `deluge_sample_convert` (see `Cargo.toml`) as a normal Rust dependency, and `cc`-compiled static
//! libraries with no `links` key (neither crate declares one) have their `cargo:rustc-link-lib`/
//! `-search` directives forwarded to every downstream binary/test in the same crate graph — exactly how
//! `deluge_sample_convert` already reaches `deluge-bsp-rust`'s own final device/host_app link today. So
//! `deluge_sample_convert`'s ALREADY cc-compiled `convert.cpp.o`/`stitch.cpp.o` (built by ITS build.rs,
//! which — being a dependency — runs and completes before this one does) is already on this test
//! binary's link line by the time these two symbols need resolving, and the linker (rust-lld, which does
//! iterative multi-pass symbol resolution across all provided static archives, not a single left-to-
//! right sweep) picks them up from there.
//!
//! This is a real, load-bearing choice, not a shortcut: if this build.rs instead recompiled
//! `convert.cpp`/`stitch.cpp` itself into a SECOND archive, that archive's `convert.cpp.o`/
//! `stitch.cpp.o` would ALSO be pulled into the final link (to satisfy THIS crate's own
//! `harness_shim.cpp.o`'s references) alongside `deluge_sample_convert`'s copy (pulled in to satisfy
//! ITS `shim.cpp.o`'s references, needed by `fill_logic::finish_convert_stitch`, called from the
//! differential test) — two definitions of the same externally-linked, non-template C++ symbols
//! (`deluge::audio::stream::convert_word`, `deluge::audio::stream::stitch_boundaries`) landing in one
//! link is a genuine "duplicate symbol" error, not a hypothetical one. Not recompiling them here avoids
//! it categorically, and as a bonus needs no argon/SIMDe dependency-fetch of its own — `harness_shim.o`
//! only needs their INCLUDE PATHS (for the template instantiation and the `RawDataFormat`/`ConvertGeometry`/
//! `StitchPrevEdge`/`StitchNextEdge` type declarations), reused directly from `sample_convert`'s own
//! already-fetched `third_party/` cache (see below) rather than fetching a second pinned copy.
//!
//! ## Reusing `sample_convert`'s fetched argon + SIMDe, not fetching a second copy
//!
//! `deluge_sample_convert`'s build.rs fetches argon + SIMDe (pinned by SHA) into its own
//! `sample_convert/third_party/` cache. Since `deluge_sample_convert` is THIS crate's normal
//! dependency, Cargo always finishes building it (running its build.rs to completion) before running
//! this one — so that cache is guaranteed to exist by the time this script needs it, from ANY directory
//! `cargo test`/`cargo build` is invoked from (Cargo resolves the whole dependency graph bottom-up
//! regardless of the invocation directory). Pointing straight at that directory (a plain filesystem
//! path, not a `DEP_*` build-script variable — `sample_convert`'s build.rs exports none) avoids a
//! redundant network fetch of the identical pinned SHAs.
