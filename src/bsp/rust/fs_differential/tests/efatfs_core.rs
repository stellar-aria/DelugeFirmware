//! Host coverage of the REAL `efatfs_core` handle-table logic.
//!
//! The device handle table (`src/efatfs_fs.rs`) is `#![cfg(target_os = "none")]`
//! and can't be reached from any host build; its logic lives in the
//! storage-generic `src/efatfs_core.rs`. This test `#[path]`-includes that
//! exact source and drives it over `fs_differential`'s host `FileSystem`
//! (`FileBlockDevice` → `BufStream` → embedded-fatfs), so the generation guard,
//! the `FileContext` detach/reattach, and the fill loop get real execution on
//! host.
//!
//! DIVERGENCE: host is single-threaded `block_on`, so this validates the core's
//! logic (round-trip, interleave, recycle guard) ONLY, not the device
//! `static`/embassy-`Mutex` serialization — that still needs on-device
//! verification.

// Recompile the real core into this test binary (same `#[path]` convention the
// BSP host tests use). efatfs_core depends only on embedded_fatfs +
// embedded_io_async, both of which are fs_differential deps.

// long-distance seeking costs about `1 + n/16384` for an n-cluster file.
// Measured at n=2048 (64 MB, `/SAMPLES/huge.bin`): **1.15x**, ~9.8 extra

// path, then EVERY already-written cluster -- not just the most recently written one -- reading
// back byte-exact through the SAME still-open, unflushed write context, and a final flush+close
// making the whole file visible byte-exact to a fresh mount.
