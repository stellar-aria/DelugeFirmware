/// A small C++23 bridge over `libdeluge/sample_reader.h` (the Rust `deluge_sample_reader_*`
/// C-ABI, U1) for non-voice consumers that read raw-PCM frame RANGES (pitch detect, waveform
/// overview, crossfade averages, perc-cache, wavetable build, hop search) instead of reaching
/// `StreamedChunk` internals the way they do today. Additive: nothing calls this bridge yet (that
/// is U2's later tasks) -- it coexists with the existing facade (`peek`/`prefetch`/`load_now`/
/// `request`/`dequeue`, `deluge::audio::stream`), which stays untouched.
