# Host harness (`deluge-bsp-rust`, M1)

The Rust/Embassy BSP (`src/bsp/rust`) dual-targets: `cargo device`
(`armv7a-none-eabihf`) builds the real Deluge firmware image; plain `cargo
build`/`cargo run`/`cargo test` (no `--target`, or `--target
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`) build a **host** binary that runs the same
`scheduler.rs`/`fiber.rs`/`sd.rs`/`services.rs` modules on `std`, off
hardware. All host-only code is `#[cfg(not(target_os = "none"))]`; the device
build/behaviour is unchanged by any of this (see `cargo device` in the repo
root's normal CI — still links the ARM firmware image byte-for-byte the same
as before M1).

## What M1 runs on host

1. **Fiber selftest** (`fiber::selftest()`, Task 3) — exercises the
   cooperative context switch in isolation (main → fiber → yield → resume →
   complete) on the host `corosensei`-backed switch. Run by `deluge-rust`'s
   host `fn main()` at startup.
2. **SD round-trip** (`sd.rs`'s `host_disk` shim, Task 4) — writes a
   deterministic pattern to a file-backed block device via the real
   `deluge_block_write`/`deluge_block_read` C-ABI, reads it back, and asserts
   the bytes survive.
3. **Scheduler/fiber concurrency exercise** (`tests/scheduler_host.rs` +
   `tests/support/scheduler_host_exercise.rs`, Task 5 — this document) — brings
   up a real host `embassy_executor::Executor` on its own thread (mirroring
   `main.rs`'s device `executor.run(...)` and the deluge-sdk `host::run`
   template) and drives `scheduler.rs` through the actual `scheduler_api.h`
   C ABI: two repeating tasks, an once-task, a conditional task (predicate
   gated), a block/unblock cycle, a `runTask` nudge, and a `deluge_worker_run`
   fiber op that suspends in `scheduler::yield()` (`fiber::yield_until`) until
   its own gate opens — exercising the corosensei stack switch under the
   executor, not just the queue plumbing around it. All driving/assertion
   calls after registration run on a *different* OS thread than the executor,
   so this is genuine cross-thread concurrency into the scheduler's C ABI, not
   just async interleaving on one thread.

`cargo build`/`cargo run` (host) still only run 1–2 at startup (unchanged from
Task 4); the Task 5 exercise lives in `tests/` + `examples/` and is invoked
separately (`cargo test`, or the TSan invocation below) — it does not run as
part of the plain host binary's `fn main()`.

### Why `tests/` needs `#[path]`, and why there's also an `examples/` entry point

`deluge-bsp-rust` is bin-only (`[[bin]] name = "deluge-rust"`, no `[lib]`
target — see `Cargo.toml`), so nothing under `tests/`/`examples/` can `use
deluge_bsp_rust::...`. Both entry points instead declare the exact same `mod
fiber; mod scheduler;` tree `main.rs` does, via `#[path]` pointing at the real
sources (`src/fiber.rs`, `src/scheduler.rs`) — this **recompiles those two
files unmodified** into the test/example binary rather than duplicating their
logic; every symbol used (the `scheduler_api.h` C-ABI fns, plus
`fiber::deluge_worker_run`/`worker_poll`/`WORKER_WAKE`) was already `pub`
before Task 5, so no visibility change to `scheduler.rs`/`fiber.rs` was
needed. The actual task bodies + assertions live once, in
`tests/support/scheduler_host_exercise.rs::run()` (a `tests/<subdir>/` file,
so Cargo does not treat it as its own test binary), shared by:

- `tests/scheduler_host.rs` — the normal `cargo test` entry point (plain,
  unsanitized).
- `examples/scheduler_host_tsan.rs` — a plain `fn main()` binary for the TSan
  run (see below for why `cargo test`'s `--test` harness can't be used there).

## TSan invocation

### Finding: `--features sanitize` cannot link under `-Zsanitizer=thread`

The crate's `sanitize` feature (`corosensei/sanitizer`) was believed to be the
prerequisite for a clean TSan run over the corosensei fiber switch (see the
feature's original doc comment). Task 5 found this is wrong: `corosensei`'s
`sanitizer` feature wires `__sanitizer_start_switch_fiber`/
`__sanitizer_finish_switch_fiber`/`__asan_unpoison_memory_region` — **AddressSanitizer's**
fiber-switch annotation API (`corosensei::sanitizer`'s own module doc literally
says "Runtime support for address sanitizer"). ThreadSanitizer's runtime
(`librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a`) does not implement that API at all — `nm` on it
shows a completely different, TSan-specific fiber family instead
(`__tsan_create_fiber`, `__tsan_destroy_fiber`, `__tsan_switch_to_fiber`,
`__tsan_get_current_fiber`, `__tsan_set_fiber_name`). Building
`--features sanitize` under `-Zsanitizer=thread` fails to link with three
undefined symbols (`__sanitizer_start_switch_fiber`,
`__sanitizer_finish_switch_fiber`, `__asan_unpoison_memory_region`), confirmed
experimentally. **The M1 Task 5 TSan run does not enable `--features
sanitize`** — and doesn't need to: TSan's happens-before tracking is per real
OS thread, not per stack region, so a same-thread corosensei coroutine switch
(no new pthread involved) has no other thread to misattribute state to,
unlike ASan's per-stack redzone/fake-frame tracking which does need the
annotation. `Cargo.toml`'s `sanitize` feature comment has been corrected to
record this; the feature itself is untouched (still gates
`corosensei/sanitizer`, still useful for a future ASan pass under
`-Zsanitizer=address`).

### Finding: plain `-Zsanitizer=thread` (no `-Zbuild-std`) gives an unusable verdict

A first attempt ran `RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=thread
-Cunsafe-allow-abi-mismatch=sanitizer" cargo +nightly test --target
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu scheduler_host` (uninstrumented, prebuilt sysroot
`std`). It ran, and reported a "data race" inside `embassy_time::driver_std`'s
lazy `Inner::init()` (a `std::sync::Mutex`-guarded one-time init racing its
own spawned `alarm_thread`). This is almost certainly a **false positive**,
not a real bug: `critical-section`'s host backend (which every
`embassy_sync::blocking_mutex::raw::CriticalSectionRawMutex` in
`scheduler.rs` — `Signal`, `Mutex` — ultimately routes through) and
`embassy-time`'s own driver both serialize via `std::sync::Mutex`, and modern
Rust's `std::sync::Mutex` on Linux is a futex-based, non-pthread
implementation. Compiled *without instrumentation* (the default, prebuilt
sysroot `std`), its internal atomic lock/unlock operations are invisible to
TSan's shadow-memory happens-before tracker — so a genuinely-correctly-locked
critical section can look like an unguarded race. This is a well-known
Rust+TSan sharp edge, which is why the official guidance is to also rebuild
`std` with the sanitizer (`-Zbuild-std`). Given scheduler.rs's entire
cross-thread synchronization story (task-slot signalling, the
add/block/unblock C-ABI) rests on exactly these primitives, a run without
`-Zbuild-std` cannot give a trustworthy verdict about `scheduler.rs` itself —
so this result was discarded and `-Zbuild-std` was pursued instead of settling
for it.

### Finding: `-Zbuild-std` + host-triple == target-triple hits a Cargo bug — worked around with a custom target spec

Plain `-Zbuild-std` (`cargo +nightly test -Zbuild-std --target
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu ...`), and also the `-Zhost-config
-Ztarget-applies-to-host` variant that explicitly separates host- and
target-context `rustflags`, both hit a reproducible `error[E0152]: duplicate
lang item in crate core: sized` — the unit graph ends up with two different
`core` artifacts for one crate, whenever the host and target triple strings
are identical (the deluge-bsp-rust crate needs `bindgen` as a build-dependency
even though its `build.rs` early-returns for host builds — Cargo still
compiles declared build-dependencies regardless — and that build-dependency
graph overlaps target-context crates like `critical-section`/`memchr`/
`byteorder`, apparently confusing `-Zbuild-std`'s host/target unit
deduplication on nightly `1.98.0`). **Workaround** (standard technique for
self-hosting sanitizer builds on the same triple): a **custom target-spec
JSON**, byte-identical to `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` except its filename/
target name, so Cargo's unit graph can no longer alias "host" and "target" —
`sanitizer/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan.json` in this directory (generated via
`rustc +nightly -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, then renamed). With this, `-Zbuild-std` compiles
cleanly through the whole dependency graph.

### Finding: `cargo test`'s `--test` harness re-triggers the same bug (needs `libtest`) — worked around with a plain example binary

Once the custom target made `cargo build`/`cargo run --example` work, `cargo
test --test scheduler_host` under the same flags hit the **same** E0152 error
again — `-Zbuild-std=...,test` (needed for `libtest`) reintroduces a
host/target unit collision. Rather than fight this further, the exercise body
was factored out (see above) so it can run as a plain `fn main()` — `cargo
run --example scheduler_host_tsan` needs no `libtest` at all and sidesteps the
bug entirely, while `tests/scheduler_host.rs` remains the normal (unsanitized)
`cargo test` entry point, unaffected.

### One-time environment setup

The custom target has no prebuilt sysroot, so rustc emits a linker reference
to `<sysroot>/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan/lib/librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a`
that doesn't exist. Point it at the real one (one-time, outside the repo, in
the Rust toolchain's own directory — not a repo file):

```sh
SYSROOT=$(rustc +nightly --print sysroot)
mkdir -p "$SYSROOT/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan/lib"
ln -sf "$SYSROOT/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a" \
       "$SYSROOT/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan/lib/librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a"
```

### The exact invocation (from `src/bsp/rust`)

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=thread" TSAN_OPTIONS="halt_on_error=1" \
  cargo +nightly run \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc,std,panic_abort \
  -Zjson-target-spec \
  --target sanitizer/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan.json \
  --example scheduler_host_tsan
```

(`nightly` is this directory's default toolchain already, via
`rust-toolchain.toml`; `+nightly` is explicit here for clarity.
`rust-src`/`llvm-tools-preview` components, required for `-Zbuild-std`, are
already listed in `rust-toolchain.toml`.)

### Proof TSan is live: statically-linked interceptors + a fired negative control

The resulting binary genuinely links the TSan runtime (statically —
`nm | grep -c __tsan_` reports 50 symbols including `__tsan_init`,
`__tsan_read4`, `__tsan_write4`; `file` shows it's still a normal dynamically-linked
ELF, i.e. the TSan runtime itself is statically archived in, which is the
standard `librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a` link shape).

A throwaway negative control (`examples/tsan_negative_control.rs`, NOT
committed — deleted immediately after use) span 4 threads each doing
`for _ in 0..100_000 { *COUNTER += 1 }` on a shared `static mut i32` with no
synchronization, built and run with the *exact* invocation above (custom
target, `-Zbuild-std`, same flags). It reliably fired:

```
==================
WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race (pid=580944)
  Write of size 4 at 0x55f709715050 by thread T3:
    #0 tsan_negative_control::main::{closure#0} .../examples/tsan_negative_control.rs:16:21

    ...
SUMMARY: ThreadSanitizer: data race ... in tsan_negative_control::main::{closure#0}
==================
```
exit code 66 (TSan's `halt_on_error` convention). This confirms TSan is
genuinely instrumenting and detecting races under this invocation — a clean
result on the real exercise means "no race found," not "TSan didn't run."

## Verdict: TSan CLEAN

`scheduler_host_tsan` (the real exercise: two repeating tasks, a once-task, a
predicate-gated conditional task, a block/unblock cycle driven from a second
OS thread, a `runTask` nudge, and a `deluge_worker_run` fiber op that suspends
in `yield_until` until its own gate opens) ran **14 consecutive times** under
the invocation above — every run printed `scheduler_host_tsan: PASSED` (all
progress assertions held within the 15 s wall-clock deadlock watchdog) and
exited 0, with **zero** TSan `WARNING` output of any kind across all 14 runs.

This certifies: for the interleavings actually exercised (repeating-task
progress, cross-thread block/unblock/runTask into the scheduler's C-ABI,
predicate-gated conditional dispatch, and the corosensei fiber
suspend/resume/completion cycle under the executor), `scheduler.rs`'s and
`fiber.rs`'s synchronization is race-free — under a properly `-Zbuild-std`-
instrumented `std`, so `critical-section`'s/`embassy-time`'s internal
`std::sync::Mutex` usage is visible to the detector (not the blind spot that
made the earlier plain run's report untrustworthy). As with any TSan run,
this is one (large, seeded) concurrent schedule, not an exhaustive proof; the
progress-assertion battery + the repeated-run count give the same style of
confidence as `tests/fatfs_stress`'s TSan verdict (see `RESULTS.md` there).

## Scope notes

- Only the host `platform-std` executor thread + the driving/test thread are
  exercised. A second `std::thread` executor modelling the audio spawner
  (`SendSpawner`/`InterruptExecutor` path) is explicitly optional per the M1
  scoping doc and was not added — `AUDIO_EXEC`/`set_audio_spawner`'s
  cross-context handoff remains device-only-verified.
- No C++ app is linked on host in M1 (see `build.rs`); the synthetic
  `extern "C" fn` task bodies here stand in for the real registered Deluge
  tasks, matching the same C-ABI shape (`TaskHandle = extern "C" fn()`,
  `RunCondition = Option<unsafe extern "C" fn() -> bool>`) the C++ app would
  hand the scheduler.
- `RES_ERROR`/`RES_WRPRT`/`STA_NODISK`/`STA_PROTECT` dead-code warnings in
  `sd.rs`, and `set_spawner`/`set_audio_spawner` "never used" warnings in a
  plain (non-test/example) `cargo build`, are pre-existing (Task 4) and
  unrelated to Task 5 — the test/example targets themselves use both
  `set_spawner` and (transitively, via `scheduler.rs`) `set_audio_spawner`'s
  sibling code path, so those specific warnings disappear when building the
  test/example targets.

## M2–M5 path (from the scoping doc)

- **M2** — host peripheral stubs (`pic`/`oled`/`cv_gate`), a local shim
  standing in for the real hardware protocol.
- **M3** — host C++ app build: a host-ABI bindgen target (today's `mod sys` is
  device-only; M1's `fiber.rs`/`scheduler.rs`/`sd.rs` host stand-ins for
  `RunCondition`/`DelugeStatus`/etc. would fold into it), link the real
  `deluge_app` static lib against the host binary, host-vs-device ABI
  round-trip as the key spike.
- **M4** — audio-as-thread: lift `AUDIO_EXEC`'s `InterruptExecutor` /
  `SendSpawner` onto a real `std::thread` (`.make_send()`), extending this
  task's exercise to cover the priority-0 audio-task handoff path that was
  explicitly out of scope here.
- **M5** — a `loom` adapter alongside (not replacing) this TSan harness for
  exhaustive small-schedule model-checking, plus golden-master audio
  regression running all the way through the Embassy scheduler on host.
- Spikes flagged by the scoping doc: the "compiles ≠ runs" HAL audit (M2/M3),
  the host-vs-device ABI round-trip (M3), and the `loom`-vs-`platform-std` fit
  (M5).

## M4c: whole-app TSan enumeration (real C++ `deluge_app` under TSan)

Everything above (M1 Task 5) exercises `scheduler.rs`/`fiber.rs` alone, with
synthetic task bodies standing in for the C++ app. **This section instead
links the real, TSan-instrumented C++ `deluge_app`** into the same
`--features host_app` TSan binary, giving ThreadSanitizer visibility into
actual C++ data races (e.g. `AudioEngine`'s cross-thread globals), not just
the Rust scheduler plumbing. Spike verdict: **viable, and it organically finds
real C++ races** with no synthetic race injection needed — see
`.superpowers/sdd/m4c-instrument-spike-report.md` for the full writeup this
section summarizes.

### 1. Build the C++ app with clang + TSan (separate build dir)

A **separate CMake tree**, so it never touches or shares cache with the
default `build-embassy-hostapp/` (the plain, uninstrumented tree the rest of
this doc uses):

```sh
# From the repo root:
cmake -B build-embassy-hostapp-tsan -S sim -G Ninja \
  -DDELUGE_SIM_X64=ON \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fshort-enums -fsanitize=thread" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fshort-enums -fsanitize=thread"
ninja -C build-embassy-hostapp-tsan deluge_app fatfs NE10 eyalroz_printf \
  deluge_dsp deluge_scheduler deluge_foundation deluge_midi
```

`-fshort-enums` is required regardless of TSan (see `run_bindgen`'s comment in
`build.rs` — it's what makes the host ABI's enum layout match the arm-eabi
device build bindgen already assumes). `deluge_app` is a CMake OBJECT
library — clang only ever *compiles* these TUs here, it never links them, so
clang's own `libclang_rt.tsan*` never enters the picture; the one real link
happens later, in step 2, via rustc/lld pulling in
`librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a` (LLVM compiler-rt TSan). This is why one program
ends up with exactly one TSan runtime instead of two colliding ones.

**Compiler requirement — must be `clang`/`clang++`, and its LLVM major must
match rustc nightly's:** rustc's own sanitizer runtime is LLVM
compiler-rt (`librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a`); g++'s `libtsan` is a *different*
build of TSan's runtime with no guaranteed ABI compatibility with LLVM's, and
mixing them (two independent TSan runtimes, two independent shadow-memory
allocators, in one process) is a documented recipe for corruption/hangs, not
just a "might not find some races" risk. Check both versions line up before
relying on this:

```sh
clang++ --version                                # e.g. "clang version 22.1.8"
rustc +nightly --version --verbose | grep LLVM    # e.g. "LLVM version: 22.1.8"
```

The spike ran on a machine where these matched exactly (both 22.1.8), which
is almost certainly why the link "just worked" with no runtime-conflict
symptoms. A machine where system `clang` and rustc nightly's bundled LLVM
have skewed major versions is the likelier place to hit that risk — verify
the version match first if races look bogus (spurious reports, hangs, or
crashes inside the TSan runtime itself rather than in application code).

### 2. Point the Rust TSan build at it

Same invocation as the "exact invocation" above, plus `DELUGE_HOSTAPP_BUILD_DIR`
overridden to the TSan tree (from `src/bsp/rust`):

```sh
DELUGE_HOSTAPP_BUILD_DIR=/abs/path/to/build-embassy-hostapp-tsan \
RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=thread" TSAN_OPTIONS="halt_on_error=0" \
cargo +nightly run --features host_app \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc,std,panic_abort \
  -Zjson-target-spec \
  --target sanitizer/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan.json
```

(The one-time sysroot symlink from "One-time environment setup" above is a
prerequisite here too — it's shared across every use of the custom
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan` target, not TSan-C++-specific.)

`halt_on_error=0` (vs. the scheduler exercise's `halt_on_error=1` above) is
deliberate here: this run wants to see the *whole* set of races TSan can find
in one pass, not stop at the first one.

To go back to the plain, uninstrumented `deluge_app`, just drop
`DELUGE_HOSTAPP_BUILD_DIR` (or point it back at `build-embassy-hostapp`) and
rebuild — see "Staleness: switching build dirs always relinks" below for why
this is safe to do repeatedly with no manual cleanup.

### Staleness: switching build dirs always relinks (no manual `target/` wipe)

The spike's only real blocker wasn't a compiler/linker/ABI problem — it was a
`build.rs` staleness trap: `deluge_app` is an OBJECT library, so `build.rs`
archives its `.o`s itself (`libdeluge_app_objs.a` in `OUT_DIR`) before handing
that archive to rustc/lld. The spike found a run where CMake had been
reconfigured with `-fsanitize=thread` and `deluge_app` rebuilt, but the
*archived* `.o`s Cargo linked into the final binary were still the old,
uninstrumented ones — Cargo never re-ran the archive step, so ~10 straight
TSan runs reported zero races even though the race (`AudioEngine::audioRoutineLocked`)
was real and present. The only fix at the time was `rm -rf` of the whole
`target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan/` directory.

`build.rs`'s `host_app` path (`run_host_app`) now closes this gap two ways, so
that wipe is never needed:

- **`cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=DELUGE_HOSTAPP_BUILD_DIR`** — switching which
  CMake tree to archive from (plain vs. TSan) is itself now a tracked
  trigger, not just an unwatched env var read.
- **A content hash of the archived object closure, threaded through
  `cargo:rustc-env=DELUGE_APP_OBJS_HASH=...`.** `build.rs` already
  unconditionally rebuilds `libdeluge_app_objs.a` from whatever `.o`s are on
  disk every time it runs — the actual gap was downstream: the
  `cargo:rustc-link-arg=<archive path>` directive handed to rustc is the same
  *string* whether the archive's bytes are the TSan build or the plain one,
  so from Cargo's point of view "the build script's output didn't change",
  which is what Cargo actually diffs to decide whether the final binary needs
  relinking — the archive path not changing can look like nothing to redo,
  independent of whatever mtime-tracking bugs did or didn't fire on the way
  in. Hashing the objects' actual content and emitting the hash as
  `rustc-env` forces that diff to show a change whenever the archived bytes
  differ, so the final `deluge-rust` link always gets redone against the
  fresh archive.

Verified directly (see `.superpowers/sdd/wt1-report.md` for the full
transcript): building both trees, then round-tripping
`DELUGE_HOSTAPP_BUILD_DIR` between them across successive `cargo build`s with
**no `target/` wipe at any point**, correctly flips the linked binary between
0 and ~450 `__tsan_*` symbols (`nm <binary> | grep -c __tsan`) each time,
matching the pointed-at tree.

### Compile: clean, no TU special-casing

All 348 `deluge_app` translation units (plus the 7 dependency archives)
compile clean under `clang++ -fshort-enums -fsanitize=thread -std=gnu++26`.
The only warnings are the same pre-existing ones the non-TSan build already
produces (`[[gnu::hot]]` ignored-attribute, a couple of
`-Wimplicit-const-int-float-conversion` hits in the fixed-point DSP code, one
`-Wint-to-pointer-cast` in `smsysex.cpp`) — no file needed a TSan-specific
exception.

### What this finds (scope note — the actual race hunt is a separate task)

This section only covers the *build wiring*; running the harness and
triaging what TSan reports is out of scope here. For reference, the spike's
unmodified, stock-window run organically reproduced two real, still-open
cross-thread hazards on unsynchronized `AudioEngine` globals
(`audioRoutineLocked`, `audioSampleTimer`) in 4 of 5 runs — see the spike
report for the full TSan output. Whether a given local run reproduces a race
depends on scheduling, same as any TSan result: a clean run means "not seen
this time," not "race-free."
