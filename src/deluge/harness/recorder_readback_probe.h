/// @brief Host-only C-ABI diagnostic: can a still-recording sample be read back through the same
///        region-port cursor real playback uses?
///
/// `deluge_harness_recorder_probe()` constructs a real `SampleRecorder`, feeds it a small amount of
/// deterministic audio (leaving it in `RecorderStatus::CAPTURING_DATA` — never finalized/closed, so
/// its Sample genuinely has no efatfs read handle, `SampleStream::efatfs_handle() == 0`, exactly the
/// "still-recording" condition), then opens a `DelugeSampleSource` cursor against that Sample's
/// `SampleStream` and calls `deluge_sample_region_acquire_ex(index=0)` — the exact same region-port
/// entry point `SampleLowLevelReader` uses for real playback (see `sample_low_level_reader.cpp`). The
/// returned `DelugeRegionState`: `SampleStream::make_read_source()` always returns an
/// `EfatfsReadSource` over a 0 handle for a still-recording Sample, so the read fails and the async
/// fill task re-queues it at lowest priority (`streaming_loader.rs`'s `fill_once`) rather than failing
/// outright -- the acquire is expected to settle on LOADING, uniformly, on every target.
///
/// `DELUGE_HOST`-only, same reach as `harness/streaming_scenario.h` (compiled into
/// deluge_host/deluge_render/deluge_loadcheck AND the Rust Embassy `host_app` build, never the ARM
/// device firmware). Leaks the `SampleRecorder`/`Sample` for the process's life — a one-shot
/// diagnostic run, not a long-lived service; acceptable here.
