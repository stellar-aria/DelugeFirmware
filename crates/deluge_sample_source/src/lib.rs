// `deluge_resource::sync` calls out to three C-ABI critical-section primitives that,
// in the real firmware/host-sim link, the BSP (`src/bsp/rust/src/services.rs`)
// provides. `deluge_resource`'s own `cargo test` binary supplies host stubs for
// them internally (`sync::stubs`, `#[cfg(test)]`-gated and crate-private), but that
// module isn't visible to downstream crates — so this crate's own test binary,
// which links `deluge_resource` as a plain (non-test) rlib, must provide the same
// three symbols itself or every test here fails to link. Single-threaded-per-test
// critical section backed by the `critical-section` host `std` impl, mirroring
// `deluge_resource::sync::stubs` (minus its enter/exit counters, which nothing here
// asserts on).
