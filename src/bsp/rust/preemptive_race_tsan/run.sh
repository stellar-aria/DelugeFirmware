# Lens 2 harness runner: audio-preempts-streaming race check under ThreadSanitizer.
#
# Runs the `host_app` scenario path wired into `main.rs` (real song load, real-
# time playback on its own preemptive OS-thread executor, a concurrent output recording) —
# see main.rs's `host_app` boot block and scenario.rs's module doc — against the TSan-
# instrumented `deluge_app` (HOST_HARNESS.md's "M4c" section), for N
# iterations, and categorizes every TSan finding it sees against the two catalogs in this
# directory.
#
# Each finding is classified PRIMARILY on its RACE SITE — the `SUMMARY: ThreadSanitizer:`
# line, same as TSan's own one-line summary — not the whole stack. A catalog pattern only
# gets to look past the site (at every frame of both racing accesses, from the `WARNING:
# ThreadSanitizer: data race` line through the terminating `SUMMARY:` line) if it is
# explicitly tagged `DEEP <pattern>` in the catalog file. This split matters: on the audio
# thread, almost every finding's stack passes through the same call-graph roots
# (`AudioEngine::routine()`/`routine_task()`, `deluge_app_render`, ...) as ANCESTORS, not as
# the site — matching a broad file/subsystem pattern against every frame would make it match
# almost any audio-thread finding regardless of where the race actually is, silently
# absorbing a genuinely new race that merely happens to run on that thread. DEEP is reserved
# for the one class that legitimately needs it: a finding whose SUMMARY site is a bare
# compiler/runtime intrinsic intercept (`__tsan_memcpy`, `strlen`, ...) with no source
# location at all, where the real site is a specific, already-identified deeper frame (e.g.
# `src/lib/printf.c`) — see known_patterns.txt's header and class-2 note for the full
# rationale and evidence.
#   - known_patterns.txt          — pre-existing, unrelated-to-streaming debt, matched by
#                                    broad file/subsystem SITE pattern (see that file's header
#                                    for why patterns, not exact lines).
#   - open_findings_races.txt     — real races found on the cluster/loaded/recorder state
#                                    itself (documented, not suppressed, not fixed — see
#                                    that file's header).
# Anything matching NEITHER catalog is reported as UNCATALOGUED and fails the run — that is
# the thing this script exists to protect: a genuinely new streaming/priority/flip race must
# never silently hide behind the known noise above.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run.sh                      # build + 5 runs, default Cordae fixture, 500 blocks
#   NUM_RUNS=3 BLOCKS=2000 ./run.sh
#   DELUGE_SD_IMAGE=/path/to/cached.img ./run.sh   # skip repacking the FAT image
#   SKIP_BUILD=1 ./run.sh         # reuse an already-built TSan tree + binary (fast iteration)
#   ./run.sh --self-test          # no build/run: replay self_test/*.log fixtures through the
#                                  # classifier and assert each matches its *.expect verdict
#                                  # (open/known/uncatalogued) — the regression test for this
#                                  # classifier's own logic, independent of the TSan binary.
#
# Prerequisites (see HOST_HARNESS.md's M4c section for the one-time setup):
#   - clang/clang++ whose LLVM major matches `rustc +nightly`'s bundled LLVM.
#   - the sysroot symlink for librustc-nightly_rt.tsan.a under the custom
#     x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-tsan target (HOST_HARNESS.md, "One-time environment setup").
#   - mtools (mformat/mcopy) if DELUGE_SD_IMAGE isn't pre-set and no cached fixture exists.
#
# Known gotcha: each unset-DELUGE_SD_IMAGE
# invocation packs a fresh ~2.5GB /tmp/deluge-streaming-scenario-*.img and leaves it behind.
# Repeated invocations without cleanup can exhaust a tmpfs /tmp; separately (independent of
# free space), packing an image and consuming it as the SD backing store WITHIN THE SAME
# process was observed to be unreliable on this host — the scenario would report
# `load_dispatched=false` (currentSong never got set during boot) on every run. Reusing an
# already-packed image via `DELUGE_SD_IMAGE=...` (packed by a PRIOR, separate process) was
# 100% reliable across dozens of runs. If a run reports `load_dispatched=false` with
# `boot_ready=true`, prefer the cached-image form over debugging boot ordering — and
# periodically `rm -f /tmp/deluge-streaming-scenario-*.img` between sessions.
