# A second, much larger file (64 MiB = 2048 clusters) so the adversarial
# seek-cost test (efatfs_core_adversarial_seek_transfer_overhead) has a chain
# long enough for the FAT re-walk cost to be measurable at all: at 32 clusters
# (big_multicluster.bin) the whole chain fits in one 512-byte FAT sector and
# the re-walk cost is under measurement noise. FAT32 image only — the FAT16
# image is 64 MB total and cannot hold a 64 MB file plus the rest of the tree.
