# A deterministic multi-cluster file (1 MiB) so the Lens-1 transfer-overhead
# proxy (tests/efatfs_core.rs) exercises a real cluster chain — the small tree
# fixtures are all <= 1 cluster. Content is a fixed byte (0x55); only its
# length/cluster-count matters. Generated (not committed) to keep the repo lean.
#
# A second, much larger file (64 MiB = 2048 clusters) so the adversarial
# seek-cost test (efatfs_core_adversarial_seek_transfer_overhead) has a chain
# long enough for the FAT re-walk cost to be measurable at all: at 32 clusters
# (big_multicluster.bin) the whole chain fits in one 512-byte FAT sector and
# the re-walk cost is under measurement noise. FAT32 image only — the FAT16
# image is 64 MB total and cannot hold a 64 MB file plus the rest of the tree.
# Content is per-512-byte-sector-varying (byte = (offset>>9)&0xff), not a
# constant fill: the R0a streaming-pattern non-vacuity test
# (efatfs_streaming_pattern_nonvacuous, tests/efatfs_core.rs) needs distinct
# cluster contents to prove the differential can detect a wrong-offset read.
