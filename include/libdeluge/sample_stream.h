///
/// A fixed-capacity table of open efatfs streaming handles (`deluge_sample_stream` Rust crate),
/// each pairing an efatfs read handle with the resource-manager asset id + geometry a caller
/// supplies once known, registering the asset's `DelugeStreamingFillContext`
/// (`streaming_fill.h`) with the resource manager itself the moment both are present. Handles are
/// opaque `uint32_t`s (`0` = invalid/fail), NOT a pointer — the registry owns a fixed slot table
/// rather than heap-boxing per-stream state.
///
/// This is the U4c rung's relocation target: a later task flips `SampleStream`'s own held efatfs
/// handle + geometry (`sample_stream.cpp`'s `register_fill_context`) onto this registry, so the
/// C++ side stops holding that state itself.
