/// @brief Per-`Sample` orchestrator for streaming a sample's audio off the SD card in FAT-cluster-sized
///        chunks.
///
/// Every `Sample` owns exactly one `SampleStream` (as a member). It is a thin forwarding facade
/// (U4c) over the `deluge_sample_stream` Rust registry (`include/libdeluge/sample_stream.h`), which
/// holds this sample's streaming state behind one opaque `stream_handle_` once a real efatfs file
/// is open:
///   - residency itself, which lives entirely in the resource manager (SR3e retired the former
///     app-side residency-table mirror; there is nothing left on `SampleStream` for a caller to index
///     directly). Non-voice consumers reach it through the reader C-ABI (`SampleFrameReader` /
///     `deluge_sample_read` / `deluge_sample_peek` / `deluge_sample_reserve_*` /
///     `deluge_sample_invalidate`); the voice reaches it through the region port;
///   - the open **efatfs read handle** used to pull cluster bytes off the card (R1's streaming read
///     path), owned by the registry slot behind `stream_handle_`;
///   - the sample's **resource-manager Asset** id: cached locally (`resource_asset_id_`, the source of
///     truth for resource_asset_id()) and write-through-mirrored onto the registry slot once
///     `stream_handle_` is real -- a still-recording Sample never opens a registry slot at all (no
///     file exists yet to open), yet still needs its Asset id cached idempotently and its (handle-
///     less) fill-context registered directly so a premature cluster read fails cleanly instead of
///     stalling with no fill-context at all; see register_fill_context() and
///     resource_asset_id()/set_resource_asset_id(). The Asset's *definition* + the `construct`
///     callback the manager invokes live in `chunk_residency.cpp` (`deluge_streaming_define_asset()`),
///     not here (eviction needs no callback — the manager frees the trivially-destructible slab chunk
///     itself);
///   - **read-source selection** — the single place a cluster read is issued from (make_read_source()).
///
/// Callers reach a cluster's bytes through the reader C-ABI or the region port (each dispatching to the
/// resource manager for residency); none branches on how a cluster's bytes are read.
///
/// @note **Real-time contract.** The audio render thread never calls into `SampleStream` per sample —
///       it reads already-resident chunk bytes by pointer from its own lookahead array. It only touches
///       this class at cluster-boundary crossings, to enqueue the next cluster via the resource manager,
///       which never blocks on I/O.
///

///          read stream and Asset. This transitively makes `Sample` non-movable.
