//! SR2d-4 Task 6 host end-to-end: drives the full read -> convert -> stitch -> publish pipeline over a
//! REAL `deluge_resource` manager (pure Rust, no C++), reading a SYNTHETIC "file" (an in-memory byte
//! buffer) instead of `efatfs_host_shim::read_at` — see below for why, and what's covered elsewhere
//! instead.
//!
//! ## Why not `efatfs_host_shim::read_at` / real `ProdOps` (a deliberate, documented deviation)
//!
//! `efatfs_host_shim.rs` is gated `#![cfg(feature = "host_app")]`, and `deluge-bsp-rust`'s `host_app`
//! Cargo feature does far more than pull in the storage stack this test would actually touch: its
//! `build.rs` archives the FULL host-built C++ `deluge_app` object closure and force-roots the link at
//! `deluge_app_init` (`-Wl,-u,deluge_app_init`) — which then needs the WHOLE boot-time provider surface
//! satisfied (board/display/USB/OLED init, ~20+ symbols), not just the storage path. Verified
//! empirically: enabling `--features host_app,async_streaming_loader` on a plain `deluge_resource`-
//! only host test (normally built with neither feature) fails to link with 20+ undefined symbols
//! (`deluge_control_enable_oled`, `deluge_board_init_early`, `openUSBHost`,
//! `deluge_board_unlock_data_cache`, ...) — exactly the "cc-compiling a large C++ closure" case the
//! brief calls out as the trigger to fall back to a host adapter instead. (Before U4d, `ProdOps`'s
//! two `StreamedChunk` accessors — `deluge_streaming_chunk_payload`/`_set_loaded` — were ALSO
//! C++-defined, `async_fill.cpp`, a second reason `ProdOps`/`fill_once` were out of reach here; U4d
//! relocated the streamed chunk's storage into `deluge_sample_fill::chunk`, Rust, so that reason no
//! longer applies — the `host_app` closure above remains the one still standing.)
//!
//! So this test takes the "host adapter" path the brief explicitly sanctions, extended one step
//! further: it also stands in a plain in-memory buffer for the SD-backed file `efatfs_host_shim::
//! read_at` would otherwise read, rather than pulling in the whole `host_app`-gated storage stack
//! (`crate::sd` / `deluge-bsp` / `embedded-fatfs`) for a read whose CONTRACT (fill `dst` from
//! `byte_offset`, report success) is trivial. [`synthetic_read_at`] below matches
//! `efatfs_host_shim::read_at`'s own documented contract exactly ("Read `dst.len()` bytes from
//! absolute `byte_offset` of the file behind `handle`. Returns `true` iff the full buffer was
//! filled."). This test's job is the fill ORCHESTRATION (read -> convert -> stitch -> publish), not
//! re-proving the FAT read path — that path (and the per-asset fill-context REGISTRATION table this
//! test also skips, building a [`fill_logic::FillGeometry`] by hand instead) already has its own
//! dedicated host coverage (`tests/streaming_fill_context_host.rs`).
//!
//! Everything else here is real: a genuine `deluge_resource` manager (built over a real heap via its
//! C-ABI), and the real `fill_logic::begin`/`finish_convert_stitch` (SR2d-4 Tasks 4-5). Convert-state
//! itself is plain local `fill_logic::ConvertState` values rather than the chunk's own real store
//! (SR2d-4 Task 2 moved the live store onto the streamed chunk's convert-state accessors — real Rust
//! since U4d, but this test still keeps its own plain local values, since driving the real store
//! would mean pulling in `ProdOps`/`fill_once` from `deluge-bsp-rust`, out of reach here for the
//! `host_app`-closure reason above; `tests/native_finish_glue.rs` is the gate that drives the real
//! store instead — see its own module doc). A never-`finish`ed chunk's state is simply zeroed
//! `ConvertState::default()`, matching what the real store would report for a chunk nothing has ever
//! written. Only the orchestration `ProdOps::begin`/`finish` themselves perform (resolve geometry,
//! drive the read, gather neighbours, call `finish_convert_stitch`, publish) is reproduced by hand
//! here, mirroring `streaming_loader.rs`'s `prod` module's own logic (not `fill_once`/`ProdOps`
//! directly, which live behind the `host_app` closure).
