//! Lens 1 (streaming-underrun harness): a single-threaded, DETERMINISTIC
//! virtual-time discrete-event simulation of the real `host_app` (song load,
//! sustained playback, concurrent record), measuring `loaded`-miss underruns
//! (`deluge::harness::noteUnderrunWait`/`noteUnderrunUnassign`) as a function of
//! modeled SD latency / audio compute budget — reproducibly, independent of host
//! CPU speed.
//!
//! # Executor + clock
//!
//! Two `embassy_executor::raw::Executor` instances — MAIN (this file's driver loop) and
//! `HP_EXEC` (Task 2's host emulation of a device interrupt executor, see [`preempt`]) —
//! plus a custom context-routed `__pender` (two `AtomicBool` flags, one per executor, see
//! `preempt::note_pend`) and a `PeekableMockDriver` ([`clock`] — custom discrete-event shape
//! for virtual-time simulation). The driver loop: poll MAIN to quiescence,
//! draining `HP_EXEC` alongside it (`preempt::pump_hp`), peek the next due deadline, jump
//! the virtual clock to exactly that deadline, repeat. No `platform-std`/`executor-thread`
//! embassy-executor feature is enabled (see `Cargo.toml`), so there is no executor-supplied
//! `__pender` in this binary — both instances share the one below, and it is ours.
//!
//! # The boot livelock (see `sd.rs`'s `sim_latency::off_fiber_instant` doc
//! comment for the full mechanism)
//!
//! `deluge_app_init` calls the boot-time FatFS mount SYNCHRONOUSLY, off the
//! worker fiber, via `embassy_futures::block_on` — a tight busy-spin poll loop
//! (confirmed by reading `embassy-futures` 0.1.2's actual source: `loop { if let
//! Ready(v) = fut.poll(cx) { return v } }`, no thread parking, no waker use at
//! all) that never returns control to anything else on this one OS thread. Under
//! `sim_latency`, that polled future is `sim_latency::modeled_read`, whose
//! completion depends on a separately spawned `pump()` task's
//! `Timer::after(latency).await` being POLLED by the executor — but the
//! executor's own `poll()` call is already on the stack (it's the one polling
//! the boot task, which is itself inside the synchronous `deluge_app_init` call,
//! which is inside `block_on`'s spin loop): nothing else can be polled until
//! that whole call stack unwinds. Lens 2 (`../src/main.rs`'s `host_app` block)
//! sidesteps this by running `pump` on a second real OS thread — not available
//! here (single-threaded, virtual clock; a real *thread* would reintroduce
//! wall-clock waiting and a second executor OUTSIDE this loop's quiescence
//! check, defeating determinism). A second *executor* driven from INSIDE that
//! same quiescence check, on the same OS thread, is exactly what `HP_EXEC`
//! (`preempt`) is: it never waits on anything wall-clock, and the driver loop
//! still polls it to quiescence every pass, so determinism is preserved. This
//! is why `sim_block`/`preempt` exist — see their module docs for the fuller
//! mechanism (Task 2, R5a Phase 0), and R5a Phase 1's plan to move
//! `streaming_fill_task` there too.
//!
//! Fix: `sd.rs`'s `sim_latency::set_off_fiber_instant` (a small, additive,
//! off-by-default change to that SHARED file) makes an off-fiber modeled
//! transfer skip the modeled delay entirely and go straight to the real
//! (synchronous) read — no `Timer`/`pump` involved at all, so there is nothing
//! for the busy-spin to wait ON. Safe/faithful because the only off-fiber
//! transfers that can ever occur here are the boot-time FatFS mount plus
//! whatever essential-sample reads `deluge_app_init` issues synchronously
//! before the fiber exists — load's own essential-sample reads have no
//! real-time deadline the underrun counters care about, and this extends that
//! reasoning one step earlier, to the mount itself.
//! Every transfer AFTER the fiber exists (song load's essential-sample fetches,
//! sustained streaming, recording) is genuinely ON-fiber (`block_on_fiber`, a
//! coroutine YIELD — not a busy spin: it suspends the fiber and returns control
//! to whoever called `fiber::worker_poll()`, which `.await`s normally
//! afterwards) — modeled latency applies there exactly as it does for Lens 2,
//! driven correctly by the SAME `sim_latency::pump` task, spawned once at
//! boot — now on `HP_EXEC`, not MAIN (Task 2; see `preempt`'s module doc for
//! why moving it there, rather than off-thread, keeps this deterministic).
//!
//! # Reused shared substrate
//!
//! `#[path]`-includes the SAME source files `deluge-bsp-rust`'s own `host_app`
//! build compiles (`fiber.rs`, `scheduler.rs`, `sd.rs`, `board.rs`, `control.rs`,
//! `display.rs`, `ffi.rs`, `ffi_extra.rs`, `flash.rs`, `services.rs`,
//! `audio_host.rs`, `scenario.rs`, `sd_image.rs`) — a second, independently
//! configured COMPILATION of the same source (this package's own `mod
//! sys`/Cargo features), not a fork: a change to any of these files is picked
//! up by both packages. The shared-file BEHAVIOR changes this file makes are
//! the two small, additive, off-by-default hooks called below
//! (`sd::sim_latency::set_off_fiber_instant`,
//! `scheduler::set_audio_period_override_us` — both documented at their
//! definitions in `sd.rs`/`scheduler.rs`), plus a third as of Task 2:
//! `preempt::init` calls `sim_block::set_progress_hook` and
//! `sim_block::set_spin_budget(10_000)` (overriding that shared file's own
//! `100_000` default) — see `sim_block.rs`'s and `preempt.rs`'s module docs.
