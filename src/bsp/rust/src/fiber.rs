//! A single cooperative **stackful fiber** for the long, synchronous C++ operations
//! that pause via the scheduler's `yield()` (song load, stem export, grid clip
//! create). On the decomposed Embassy BSP a synchronous `yield()` can't hand the
//! CPU back to the executor, so those operations froze it (hanging
//! song-load-while-playing). A fiber suspends the *whole* call stack at `yield()` —
//! regardless of depth or return values — so the C++ stays unchanged; the embassy
//! worker (app_task) resumes it when its predicate holds, running every other task
//! and I/O in between. This is the Loom/goroutine pattern.
//!
//! This module is the load-bearing primitive: the Cortex-A9 (AArch32) cooperative
//! context switch plus a `selftest`. The full worker (op queue, predicate wait, the
//! `yield`/`deluge_worker_*` C ABI) builds on top.
//!
//! The low-level switch is the only part that differs per target: on device
//! (`target_os = "none"`) it's the ARM `global_asm!` register-save switch below;
//! on host it's [`corosensei`](https://docs.rs/corosensei)'s stackful
//! `Coroutine`/`Yielder`, chosen over `ucontext`/`swapcontext` because it has
//! built-in sanitizer support (needed for ThreadSanitizer) instead of
//! requiring hand-written `__tsan_switch_to_fiber` annotations around every
//! switch. Both sides present the same `start`/`resume`/`yield_now`/`on_fiber`
//! contract to the portable layer below.
//!
//! Concurrency: single fiber, single-threaded executor. The fiber and the embassy
//! worker task never run at once (a switch hands control between them); the only
//! other context is IRQs, which save/restore everything they touch (incl. the VFP
//! save in the HAL `_irq_handler`), so an IRQ may preempt the fiber harmlessly.
#![allow(dead_code)] // the driver that calls start/resume/yield lands in the next step
