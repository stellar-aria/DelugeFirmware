/// libdeluge/stream_io.h — real-time Sample audio streaming (playback read,
/// recording write).
///
/// Scoped specifically to `Sample` cluster streaming (`SampleStream`'s read
/// source for playback, `SampleRecorder` for the write side) -- not a general
/// file API. `WaveTable`/presets/songs stay on `file_io.h`. See
/// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-deluge-stream-boundary-design.md.
///
/// The whole boundary is the `deluge_efatfs_stream_*` C-ABI below, backing
/// `deluge::io::Stream` (stream.hpp/.cpp): a persistent write handle held
/// open across a whole recording, `write_at`/`read_at_via` positional but
/// never sparse (`byte_offset` may be anywhere at or below the stream's
/// current end of file, never past it -- callers append whole clusters in
/// increasing index order, then rewrite already-written bytes in place via
/// `SampleRecorder`'s finalize header patch and `alterFile`'s cluster
/// rewrites), and an EOF-honest `read_at_via` that is NOT the streaming read
/// path (that goes through embedded-fatfs, `deluge_efatfs_read_at`) -- it is
/// only the read-BACK of a stream this boundary is itself writing.
