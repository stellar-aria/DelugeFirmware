// Published<T> -- the "publish spine" primitive for the audio snapshot boundary.
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-audio-snapshot-boundary-design.md §5 for the
// design rationale, and docs/dev/target_architecture.md §4.2 mechanism 1 ("immutable
// snapshot + atomic pointer-swap + app-owned retire list") for the architectural slot
// this fills.
//
// Concurrency contract: SPSC-shaped. Exactly one [audio] reader thread calls load();
// exactly one [task] writer thread calls publish()/reclaim(). No multi-writer, no
// multi-reader support -- callers may rely on that; it is not re-checked at runtime
// (no <thread> dependency is taken here so this header stays compilable on the bare-
// metal/no-OS device build, not just the host sim).

/// block, before that block's `load()` calls. It is written as a plain (non-atomic)
/// self-read of the previous value followed by a **release** store -- not a
/// `fetch_add`, so there is no read-modify-write on the reader side (only [audio]
/// ever writes this counter, so the relaxed self-read races with nothing). The
/// release store is what makes the two-grace-period argument in `Published<T>`
/// correct rather than merely "true in practice on typical hardware": because the
/// store sits at the *top* of block E, everything [audio] did in program order
/// during block E-1 and earlier (including every non-atomic read of a snapshot
/// obtained from a prior `load()`) is sequenced-before this store. A [task] thread
/// that later reads the counter with `audio_epoch()` (acquire) and observes a value
/// >= E therefore *synchronizes-with* that release store, which establishes a real
/// happens-before edge from "[audio] finished reading whatever it held during block
/// E-1" to "[task] observed epoch >= E" -- not just a temporal coincidence. This is
/// what lets `Published<T>::reclaim()` free retired memory without racing the reader,
/// in the formal C++ memory-model sense (and is why `deluge::util` deliberately does
/// NOT use `memory_order_relaxed` for the epoch counter, even though the design doc's
/// prose describes it informally as "a single relaxed store" -- relaxed-only would
/// leave the free() undefined behavior, since a temporal/wall-clock argument alone is
