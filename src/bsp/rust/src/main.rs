//! Rust/Embassy firmware image for the Synthstrom Deluge (RZ/A1L).
//!
//! The third BSP for the Deluge, alongside `src/bsp/rza1` (on-device C) and
//! `src/bsp/host` (simulator). Unlike those, this one OWNS reset, `main`/`_start`
//! and the Embassy executor: the HAL startup (`rza1l_hal` `_start` →
//! `_reset_handler` → `bl main`) lands in [`main`] here, which brings up the
//! platform on the deluge-sdk HAL+BSP and runs the portable C++ application's
//! `deluge_main()` superloop inside a single Embassy task (Stage 1).
//!
//! The C++ application is compiled by CMake into `libdeluge_app.a` and linked in
//! by `build.rs`; this crate implements the `<libdeluge/...>` C-ABI services it
//! calls. See docs/dev/libdeluge_bsp_design.md.
