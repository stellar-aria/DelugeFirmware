//! `host_app` diagnostic: does reading a STILL-RECORDING sample back resolve on the target where
//! `async_streaming_loader` is on by default?
//!
//! Device/`host_app` route the fill onto the Rust async task (`streaming_loader.rs`), which reads
//! via `efatfs_fs::read_at(handle=0, ...)` — and a recording's `efatfs_handle == 0`, so a
//! still-recording sample resolves LOADING (re-queued, never READY) uniformly on every target, sim
//! included. This module turns that into a measurement: it drives
//! `harness/recorder_readback_probe.h`'s C-ABI (a real `SampleRecorder`, fed real audio, never
//! finalized) through the SAME region-port entry point (`deluge_sample_region_acquire_ex`) real
//! playback uses, on THIS target, and reports what actually comes back.
//!
//! Thread-agnostic like [`crate::scenario::run`]: only `.await`s [`embassy_time::Timer`], no thread
//! spawn, no `sim_latency` dependency. [`recorder_probe_task`] is the same not-reusable
//! `host_app`-boot convenience wrapper `scenario::scenario_task` is (spawn on the host-app
//! executor, poll [`take_result`] from the OS thread).
