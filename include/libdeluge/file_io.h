/// libdeluge/file_io.h — file-level storage access.
///
/// The application's portable code (storage_manager, audio_file_manager, the
/// browser, the companion SysEx protocol, ...) reads/writes files and
/// directories through this boundary instead of a specific filesystem
/// library. On rza1/host/Embassy this is backed by the vendored FatFS
/// library over `block_device.h`; that dependency is a BSP-internal
/// implementation detail, not something the app links against directly. A
/// BSP may instead back it with the host OS's native filesystem (e.g. a
/// Linux BSP mapping straight to POSIX I/O) with no FatFS involved at all.
///
/// Paths are plain forward-slash strings rooted at the storage volume (no
/// FatFS drive-number prefix, e.g. "SONGS/mysong.XML" not "0:/SONGS/...").
