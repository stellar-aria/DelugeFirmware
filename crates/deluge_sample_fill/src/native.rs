//! The manager-reaching cluster-fill core (C2a Task 3). Moved verbatim from
//! `deluge-bsp-rust`'s `streaming_loader.rs::prod` module (SR2d-4 Tasks 2-5) into this shared crate,
//! so the Rust BSP's async fill task (`ProdOps::begin`/`finish`) links the `native_begin`/
//! `native_finish` implementation here. (The strong `deluge_streaming_begin_fill`/`_finish_fill`
//! C-ABI overrides that also lived here — the bridge for the C++ synchronous fill path — were

//! crate itself does not define, so this module only compiles where a final link — device,
//! `host_app`, or a test harness supplying the real symbols (`region_fill_differential`) — will

///   `deluge_resource_release`, etc. — see `sample_stream.cpp`) already go through today. Nothing
///   about calling them from a synchronous, non-async context is new.
/// - [`deluge_streaming_chunk_convert_state`]/[`deluge_streaming_chunk_set_convert_state`]: plain
///   field reads/writes on a `StreamedChunk*` (see `async_fill.cpp`'s definitions) — no locking at
///   all, by design, exactly like the pre-existing [`deluge_streaming_chunk_payload`]/
///   [`deluge_streaming_chunk_set_loaded`] this function already called before this task. Safe
///   because the chunk this function touches (`chunk_backing` itself, and each neighbour just
///   after its own successful `try_acquire`) is hard-leased for the duration of this call — the
///   SAME "leased, so exclusively mine to mutate until I release it" discipline the legacy
///   sync-fiber `finish_fill` (`async_fill.cpp`) already relies on when it writes these same
///   fields directly. A synchronous caller on the single thread-mode executor (the C++ sync fill
///   path never runs on the audio render ISR either — see `streaming_loader`'s module doc) has the
///   identical exclusivity guarantee this async task has today.
/// - [`deluge_resource_mark_ready`]: also masked inside the manager, same as the acquire/release
///   pair above.
///
/// In short: nothing this function does depends on running on the Embassy executor specifically —
/// it depends only on the caller already holding a lease on `chunk_backing` (true for both the
/// loader-queue chunk this async task pops and the chunk the sync C++ path would already be
/// holding a lease on to call this at all) and on the manager's existing masked-critical-section
/// discipline, which is unconditional regardless of caller. No new cross-context hazard was found.
