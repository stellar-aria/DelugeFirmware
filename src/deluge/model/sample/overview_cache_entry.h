///
/// `Sample`-owned (in `Sample::overviewCache_`, model/sample/sample.h), one entry per cluster.
/// Deliberately its own header (rather than a nested `Sample` type): it has no dependency beyond
/// `<cstdint>`, so it stays includable from lightweight contexts (e.g. host unit tests) that can't
/// pull in `sample.h`'s full transitive closure.
