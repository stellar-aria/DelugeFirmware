//! The streaming-underrun harness's reusable scenario driver: load a real song, start
//! real-time playback, start a concurrent output recording, then step until a target
//! number of audio blocks have rendered — the substrate two verification approaches assert
//! over: a deterministic virtual-time simulation and a preemptive-audio ThreadSanitizer
//! check.
//!
//! [`run`] is deliberately THREAD-AGNOSTIC: it never spawns an OS thread, never touches
//! [`crate::sd::sim_latency::pump`] (that mechanism needs to spawn an escape-hatch OS
//! thread, which isn't available to a single-threaded custom executor — the shape the
//! deterministic virtual-time simulation runs on), and makes no assumption about which
//! embassy executor is driving it (`platform-std`, a future single-threaded custom
//! `raw::Executor`+`MockDriver`, ...) — it only `.await`s [`embassy_time::Timer`]s in a
//! plain poll loop, which every embassy executor variant supports identically. The caller
//! is responsible for having already booted the real C++ app (`deluge_app_init` returned,
//! and *something* is draining the worker-fiber ring — see `fiber::worker_poll()`) on
//! whatever executor is driving it; this module just issues the same C-ABI calls a
//! LOAD/PLAY/RECORD button press would (`harness/streaming_scenario.h`/`.cpp` on the C++
//! side) and polls the same observable state a UI would (`LoadSongUI::isLoadingSong()`,
//! `PlaybackHandler::isEitherClockActive()`).
//!
//! [`scenario_task`] is a thin, NOT-reusable convenience wrapper used only by this crate's
//! own `host_app` boot path (`main.rs`): it spawns [`run`] as an embassy task and stashes
//! the result in a static so the OS thread that owns that executor (which cannot `.await`
//! directly) can poll for completion. Other harnesses are expected to call [`run`]
//! directly from their own executor's task graph instead of reusing this wrapper.
