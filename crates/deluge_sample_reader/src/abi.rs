//! The `deluge_sample_reader_*`/`deluge_sample_read` C ABI
//! (`include/libdeluge/sample_reader.h`). Task 1 (SR-U1) implemented the lifecycle trio —
//! `open`/`seek`/`close` — by heap-boxing a [`crate::reader::Reader`]; Task 3 added `window`/
//! `advance`/`ok`, the read core. Task 4 adds `deluge_sample_read`, the stateless copy-out
//! convenience — a thin shim over [`crate::reader::Reader::read`], which composes `open` ->
//! `window`/`advance` -> drop itself, so there is still only ONE residency path.
//!
//! Unlike `deluge_sample_source`'s `DelugeSampleSource` (a fixed, allocation-free static pool,
//! because that port's `open()`/`close()` can fire on the audio render ISR at note-start/-end),
//! this reader is explicitly a NON-voice, off-audio-thread handle — the design doc's own semantics
//! section is blocking by design ("non-voice runs off the audio thread"). Nothing here needs to
//! avoid the heap, so `open` is a plain `Box::new` + `Box::into_raw`, and `close` is `Box::from_raw`
//! + drop — no pool, no slot-recovery cast tricks.
