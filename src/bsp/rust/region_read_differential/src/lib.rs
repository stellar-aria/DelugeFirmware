//! `region-read-differential` — the reader's byte-identical gate: proves
//! `deluge_sample_reader`'s `open`/`window`/`advance`/`deluge_sample_read` deliver the exact same
//! bytes, for the exact same frames, as a direct read of a chunk's own resident payload buffer at
//! an independently computed frame -> (cluster, byte-offset) location. See
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-u1-sample-range-reader-design.md`'s "Testing / gates" section.
//!
//! Mirrors `region_fill_differential`'s structure: a standalone Cargo crate (NOT a
//! workspace member — keeps this test-only harness off the firmware/BSP Cargo graph); `tests/`
//! holds the differential gate. Pure Rust: the oracle (`tests/differential.rs`'s `oracle_frame`)
//! reads a chunk's payload directly through the Rust `deluge_sample_fill::chunk` accessor, so this
//! crate needs no `build.rs`/C++ at all.
