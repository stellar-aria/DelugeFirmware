// Pins RegionOutcome's mapping, including the reason the type exists at all: DelugeRegionState is a
// plain C enum whose READY is 1, so a boolean test on it silently inverts for UNAVAILABLE (== 3,
// truthy). The full note-on path that consumes this mapping needs a Voice/Sound/ModelStack and is
// not host-constructible, so this spec covers the piece that IS unit-testable and that the
// preview-E199 bug turned on.
