// Host bodies for the interrupt-masking C ABI that libdeluge declares and the BSP normally owns.
//
// deluge_resource's masking discipline (crates/deluge_resource/src/sync.rs) calls all three across
// the C ABI on every acquire/release, so any host driver that links a Rust staticlib re-exporting
// deluge_resource needs bodies for them even when the spec itself never contends.
//
// The no-op/false bodies are exact rather than merely adequate: these drivers are single-threaded
// and never run in ISR context, so there is nothing to mask and no interrupt to report. Matches
// tests/unit/mocks/hal_mocks.cpp's own deluge_in_interrupt.
