//! Emulated interrupt preemption for the single-threaded Lens 1 sim (R5a Phase 0).
//!
//! On device, a non-yielding `block_on` in thread mode is preempted by an interrupt
//! executor, so the task holding a lock (or the `sim_latency::pump` equivalent) still runs
//! and the spin completes. Host has one OS thread and no interrupts, so this module
//! emulates that: the spin's progress hook polls a SECOND executor (`HP_EXEC`) and then
//! advances the virtual clock.
//!
//! Polling `HP_EXEC` from inside a task running on the MAIN executor is sound: they are
//! distinct `raw::Executor` instances with distinct state, the process is single-threaded,
//! and this is precisely what `embassy_executor::InterruptExecutor::on_interrupt()` does on
//! device (poll executor B while executor A's `poll()` sits on the stack). It is NOT the
//! reentrant same-executor poll that `raw::Executor::poll` forbids.
