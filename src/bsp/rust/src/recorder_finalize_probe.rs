//! SR3b Task 3's regression gate: does a real, FINALIZED (`RecorderStatus::COMPLETE`)
//! multi-cluster recording read back correctly through the region port on THIS target?
//!
//! Commit `5bb397c2b` made `SampleRecorder` own private capture buffers, and in doing so dropped
//! the per-cluster `sample->stream().resize(...)` side effect the old `createNextCluster()` used
//! to keep the SHARED residency table (`SampleStream::table_`) sized to the real cluster count.
//! `finalizeRecordedFile()`'s no-alteration else-branch -- the only branch `AudioClip` recording
//! ever takes -- never resized that table at all, so it stayed the single entry
//! `Sample::initialize(1)` set in `setup()`. On the Rust-cursor port specifically, `num_clusters`
//! is derived independently from the finalized `audio_data_length_bytes`
//! (`abi.rs::num_clusters_for`), NOT clamped by `table_.size()` -- so `acquire(index >= 1)`
//! reaches `cluster_construct`/`cluster_materialize` (`sample_stream.cpp`), which write
//! `table_[index]` with no bounds check of their own.
//!
//! This module drives `harness/recorder_readback_probe.h`'s finalized-multicluster C-ABI (a real
//! `SampleRecorder`, fed real audio, driven all the way to `RecorderStatus::COMPLETE` so
//! `finalizeRecordedFile()` genuinely runs) through the SAME region-port entry point
//! (`deluge_sample_region_acquire_ex`) real playback uses, on THIS target, and reports the
//! residency-table sizing plus the acquired region's byte correctness.
//!
//! Thread-agnostic like [`crate::scenario::run`] and [`crate::recorder_probe::run`]: only
//! `.await`s [`embassy_time::Timer`], no thread spawn, no `sim_latency` dependency.
