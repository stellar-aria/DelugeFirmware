//! SR2d-5's payload-offset gate: drives the Rust region-port cursor
//! (`deluge_sample_source::cursor::SampleSource<ManagerResidency>`) over a REAL
//! `deluge_resource` manager whose chunk backing is a REAL streamed chunk — not
//! the Vec-backed fake `region_differential`'s own `RustBackend`/`HarnessResidency`
//! seeds (`rust_backend.rs`), which stores each cluster's "payload" directly in a
//! bare `Vec<u8>` with NO header in front of it, so `payload == backing` there by
//! construction. That made `ManagerPin::payload()`'s pre-fix bug — returning the
//! raw manager backing pointer (the chunk HEADER) instead of routing through
//! `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload` (`backing + payload_offset`, the real
//! PAYLOAD) — invisible to every existing gate. Fixed in commit `b40ae65c6`;
//! this test proves the fix against the geometry that actually exercises it.
//!
//! ## How the real streamed-chunk backing is built
//!
//! U4d relocated the streamed chunk's storage (construct + all seven field
//! accessors) into `deluge_sample_fill::chunk` (Rust) — this gate used to reuse
//! `region_fill_differential`'s cc-compiled C++ shim (`cpp/native_finish_shim.cpp`,
//! since deleted) for this; now it drives the real Rust construct/accessors
//! directly, no C++ at all. [`construct_streamed_chunk`] (a thin signature-matching
//! wrapper — see its own doc) placement-constructs a real `StreamedChunk` at a
//! `deluge_resource` asset's slab-slot base, with its payload pointer set to
//! `base + payload_offset` (`ChunkHarness::new`, mirroring
//! `native_finish_glue.rs::ChunkHarness::new`). `ChunkHarness::seed_and_mark_ready`
//! then writes `make_ramp(index)` through the REAL `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload`
//! accessor (the same real, compiler-computed offset `ManagerPin::payload()` itself
//! calls through) — never a raw `backing.add(b)` write, which would land in the
//! header instead of the payload. The manager backing pointer (`try_acquire`'s
//! return, offset 0) and the payload pointer (`deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload`'s
//! return, offset `payload_offset`, always non-zero — see
//! `deluge_sample_fill::chunk`'s own doc) are therefore GENUINELY DIFFERENT
//! addresses, exactly the geometry a backing-vs-payload confusion needs to be
//! byte-detectable: the header bytes `StreamedChunk`'s own fields hold (a payload
//! pointer, cluster_index, a few bools) don't coincidentally equal `make_ramp`'s
//! pattern, so a cursor reading from the wrong pointer fails the ramp comparison
//! immediately.
//!
//! ## How the cursor is driven
//!
//! Directly via `deluge_sample_source`'s own Rust API —
//! `ManagerResidency::new(handle, asset, cluster_size, num_clusters)` +
//! `SampleSource::new(residency, geo)` — the SAME construction `rust_backend.rs`'s
//! `RustBackend::open` and `manager_residency.rs`'s/`cursor.rs`'s own unit tests
//! use, NOT the `deluge_sample_source_open` C-ABI bridge (`abi.rs`, SR2d-5 Task 1).
//! Both `ManagerResidency` and `SampleSource` are already `pub` — no visibility
//! change was needed. The bridge would additionally require test doubles for
//! `deluge_streaming_resource_manager`/`deluge_sample_stream_asset_id` (Task 1's
//! own `open()` seam) and the allocation-free source pool's slot-claim machinery,
//! none of which this gate's payload-offset question needs — the direct API is
//! the minimal composition that drives the real cursor over a real chunk without
//! dragging in that extra layer.
//!
//! ## Teeth
//!
//! Verified by hand (never committed): reverting `ManagerPin::payload()`
//! (`manager_residency.rs`) to `self.lease.chunk().as_ptr() as *const u8` (the
//! pre-fix body) makes `cursor_resolves_real_streamed_chunk_payload_offset_correctly`
//! fail immediately — the captured bytes are the `StreamedChunk` header, not
//! `make_ramp`. See the Task 2 report for the exact failure text. Restored
//! immediately after (`git diff` on that file empty again) — no bug is committed.
