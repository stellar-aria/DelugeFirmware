//! The `deluge_sample_source_*` / `deluge_sample_region_*` C ABI
//! (`include/libdeluge/sample_source.h`), wrapping `cursor::SampleSource<
//! ManagerResidency>` behind a fixed, allocation-free static source pool --
//! reimplements `sample_source.cpp`'s pool discipline (`g_source_pool`,
//! `claim_source_slot`/`release_source_slot`) natively.
//!
//! The link-time weak/strong selector that makes these symbols win over the
//! C++ backing is the `cfg_attr` gate on each `#[no_mangle]` below (device +
//! host_app: SR2d-5 Task 4; the C-host sim: SR3a Task 1, via this crate's own
//! `sim` feature, forwarded from `deluge_rust`'s umbrella build -- see
//! `crates/deluge_rust/Cargo.toml` and `sim/CMakeLists.txt`). Still not wired
//! into the region-differential gate.
//!
//! # `open()`'s `stream_backing`
//! The reader passes its opaque `deluge::audio::stream::SampleStream*`
//! unchanged (SR2d-5 Task 1) -- the same pointer the C++ backing
//! (`sample_source.cpp`) already casts to `SampleStream*`. This module
//! bridges it to the `{manager handle, asset id}` pair `ManagerResidency`
//! needs via two C-ABI calls: `deluge_streaming_resource_manager()` (the
//! process-wide boot-singleton getter, `include/libdeluge/streaming_fill.h`)
//! and `deluge_sample_stream_asset_id(stream_backing)` (the lazy-init
//! accessor added alongside it, wrapping `SampleStream::ensure_resource_asset()`).
//! Neither call dereferences `stream_backing` on the Rust side -- it is
//! forwarded straight through as an opaque pointer, exactly as the header's
//! `void*` contract requires. Unit tests can't build a real `SampleStream`,
//! so they override both externs with test doubles driving a test
//! `deluge_resource` manager + asset (see the `tests` module below).
//!
//! # `retain`/`release` and the single boot-singleton manager
//! `deluge_sample_region_retain`/`_release` take ONLY the opaque `lease`
//! token -- no source, no manager handle -- matching the header exactly. That
//! works in the C++ backing because a lease there IS a raw `StreamedChunk*`,
//! self-sufficient with no external table lookup. `ManagerResidency`'s token
//! is `{slot<<32 | gen}` (Task 1), meaningful only relative to the specific
//! `*mut DelugeResource` that minted it, so a lease-only call needs SOME way
//! to recover that handle. Production runs exactly one boot-singleton
//! `deluge_resource` manager (the same contract `ManagerResidency::new`
//! documents), so this module caches the most-recently-`open()`-ed handle in
//! [`ACTIVE_MANAGER`] and routes standalone retain/release through it --
//! correct for this rung's single-manager reality, and it preserves the
//! header's exact signature (no added parameter). Flagged here for whoever
//! revisits a hypothetical multi-manager future.

//      `source` between its claim and the matching `close()`'s release, so two

//      doc) -- the identical mechanism, not a second one.
// The correctness model behind (1) does NOT depend on which thread runs which
// entry point. `open()` and `close()` can BOTH be invoked from the audio render
// thread -- a pooled reader reused for a new sample calls `close()` then
// `open()` on the render path via `SampleLowLevelReader::ensureSource()` -- as
// well as from the main thread (voice teardown / song swap). Soundness comes
// instead from `Masked::enter()` adapting to the CALLER's context through a live
// `deluge_in_interrupt()` check: called from the main thread it masks the audio
// ISR for the whole masked read-then-set (claim) or flip (release); called from
// the audio ISR it is a no-op, which is correct precisely because the audio ISR
// is atomic w.r.t. main (non-reentrant, un-preemptible by main). So a claim's
// masked read-then-set and a release's masked flip are each indivisible w.r.t.
// any pool operation in the OTHER context, whichever thread each actually runs
// on. Two claims never race each other (the audio ISR is single-threaded/
// non-reentrant, and a main-thread claim masks the ISR); a claim and a release
// on DIFFERENT slots never touch the same `in_use`; on the SAME slot they are
// serialized by that flag. A concurrent `acquire_ex` against an already-claimed
// slot's `source` stays coherent via (2). This protects POOL SLOT INTEGRITY
// only -- tearing down a source while something else still actively acquires
// through the SAME pointer is a pre-existing, out-of-scope hazard mirrored from
// the C++ backing (caller discipline, not this pool's job).
