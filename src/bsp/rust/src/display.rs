//! display.h — main OLED output over `deluge_bsp::oled`.
//!
//! The app renders a 128×48, 1-bpp, page-major framebuffer (768 bytes, the
//! SSD1309 wire layout) and hands it to [`deluge_display_blit_oled`]. We stash it
//! and signal [`oled_render`] — the sole owner of the panel — which runs the
//! SSD1309 init once, then streams frames over the shared RSPI0 bus (the PIC
//! drives chip-select / D-C; deluge_bsp::oled handles that handshake + DMA).
//! Async transfer behind the synchronous boundary; the app's tick yields, so the
//! render task makes progress.
//!
//! The app's framebuffer layout matches `oled::FrameBuffer` exactly (6 pages ×
//! 128 cols, bit 0 = top row of a page), so the blit is a flat 768-byte copy.
