# Known Concurrency Bugs — preemptive-audio storage/streaming path

**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED — **B1 + B2 + B3 + B7 FIXED** (B1/B2/B3 2026-07-19; B1 = the `Manager` chunk-table `Cell<ChunkSlot>` race, synchronized via asymmetric fiber-side critical sections; B2/B3 = the recorder hand-off races. B7 2026-07-21 = the efatfs block device's `SD_BUS` bypass. See each below.). **B4, B5 and B6 remain OPEN**, as do additional pre-existing **streaming-path** races the harness surfaces nondeterministically (see "Additional surfaced races"). A run's `UNCATALOGUED=0` is therefore not guaranteed; the specific, reproducible guarantee is that the recorder B2/B3 races are gone and the B1 `Cell<ChunkSlot>`/`mem::replace`/`loader_next` signatures are synchronized at the source.
**Found by:** the host streaming-underrun harness (`src/bsp/rust/preemptive_race_tsan/` — ThreadSanitizer over the real `deluge_app` with a preemptive audio thread) and its deterministic timing lens (`src/bsp/rust/lens1_vt_sim/`). All found on host, **without hardware**.

## Scope / when these bite

Bug **B5** (plus the pre-existing streaming-path races) is a data race on the audio-thread ↔ loader/fiber-thread hand-off in the **storage / cluster / resource-manager / scheduler** path (B1, on the resource-manager chunk table, and B2 + B3, on the **recorder** hand-off, are now fixed). They manifest **only when the audio task is genuinely preemptive** relative to the loader/fiber thread — i.e. on the **Embassy `InterruptExecutor` target** (see the `embassy-scheduler-migration` / `audio-callback-relocation` work). On the legacy **cooperative** BSP (audio runs cooperatively, never preempting mid-op) they cannot occur.

**⇒ The remaining open races must be fixed before the preemptive-audio architecture ships in combination with SD streaming + record-while-stream.** They are exactly the kind of narrow-window corruption that a device test tends to surface only as a rare, hard-to-repro glitch or crash — TSan makes them deterministic to find (but not to trigger in the field).

Reproduce: `cd src/bsp/rust/preemptive_race_tsan && ./run.sh` (needs a pre-packed `DELUGE_SD_IMAGE`; see `run.sh` header). Findings are catalogued in `preemptive_race_tsan/open_findings_races.txt`; the broad pre-existing cooperative-scheduling debt (UI/song-model/reverb/transport, out of scope here) is baselined in `known_patterns.txt`.

## B1 — `deluge_resource::Manager` chunk table: unsynchronized `Cell<ChunkSlot>` — HIGH — **FIXED (2026-07-19)**

- **Fix:** asymmetric fiber-side critical sections. Every `Manager` access to the shared `Cell<ChunkSlot>` state now routes through `crates/deluge_resource/src/sync.rs`'s `Masked` guard + `m_get`/`m_set`/`m_rmw`, gated on `!deluge_in_interrupt()`: the **fiber** masks a minimal O(1) window per single-cell RMW (bump/stat/loader-enqueue/loader-remove/release/add-lease/set-dirty/mark-ready/touch/loader_next winner-commit/protect set-restore); the **audio ISR** skips the mask (it can never be preempted by the fiber, so its RMWs are already atomic w.r.t. it). The **host** critical section (`src/bsp/rust/src/services.rs`) was made per-thread cross-thread-correct — its depth+token are now thread-local, so each OS thread acquires the global `critical_section` mutex on its own outermost enter (the process-global `CS_DEPTH` gate previously let a second thread skip `acquire` and provided no cross-thread exclusion — the guard's prerequisite). **Eviction scans run unmasked and commit under a re-validated masked window** (`evict_slot`/`evict_lowest`): no mask is held across an O(n) scan, `alloc_backing`, or an `on_evict` callback. `release_asset` remains **unguarded** (owner-teardown path, out of scope — see §4).
- **Verified (this session):** unit + proptest suite green (`cargo test -p deluge_resource`, 32 tests incl. `concurrent_lease_churn` + the `churn_never_violates_invariants` proptest); the crate's unit-level ThreadSanitizer coverage on `concurrent_lease_churn` reports **0 data races**, closing the `acquire`-vs-`release` `Cell<ChunkSlot>` race at the unit level; golden mixdown **bit-exact** against baseline `eae09f094e71888a…` (Tasks 1-6 changed no C++ source — confirmed `git diff` touches only `crates/deluge_resource/` + `services.rs`); firmware **green** (`./dbt build Debug`, `deluge.elf` linked, the `deluge_resource` device-path guard compiled into the image) and the `deluge_resource` device-target build green (`cargo check -p deluge_resource --target armv7a-none-eabihf`). **NOT run to completion this session:** the full `preemptive_race_tsan` end-to-end harness (its stale TSan tree needed a fresh rebuild that is expensive on this memory-pressured host and was not completed here) — the end-to-end confirmation that the B1 `Cell<ChunkSlot>` / `mem::replace` / `loader_next` SUMMARY signatures no longer fire under sustained preemptive playback+record **remains outstanding**.

- **Race (historical):** `Manager::release` (audio thread — via `Voice`/`SampleLowLevelReader` unassign → `cluster::remove_reason` → `release_lease`) vs `Manager::loader_next` (loader/fiber thread — picking the next queued cluster) on the **same `Cell<ChunkSlot>` slot**. `loader_enqueue`/`loader_remove`/`acquire`/`request`/`evict_lowest` plausibly touch the same table too — all were bare `Cell::get`/`Cell::set` with no synchronization.
- **TSan sites:** `core/src/cell.rs:555:18` (`Cell<ChunkSlot>::get`) vs `core/src/mem/mod.rs:970:49` (`mem::replace::<ChunkSlot>`).
- **Root cause:** `Manager` was written single-threaded (see its own `stat()` doc comment) but is reached from Rust-`unsafe` `extern "C"` entry points with **no lock**, so nothing enforces that assumption once C++ calls it from two real OS threads.
- **Impact:** non-atomic read-modify-write on lease counts / queued flags can silently **lose an update** → a lease undercounted → **premature eviction of a still-playing cluster** (audio glitch/wrong data), or a queued flag never cleared → the loader spins on a phantom queue entry.
- **Recorder reachability (resolved by this fix):** with B2/B3 fixed, `SampleRecorder::createNextCluster()` → `SampleStream::get_cluster(CLUSTER_DONT_LOAD)` → `deluge_resource_request` → `Manager::request` was found to also take a manager lease on the audio thread, hitting this same `Cell<ChunkSlot>` — so B1 was reached from **both** playback and the recorder. The **Fix** above (asymmetric fiber-side critical sections) covers this call path too, so the recorder's allocation site is synchronized along with the rest of `Manager`.

## B2 — `SampleRecorder`/`SampleStream` record-cluster state: `std::vector` realloc UAF — HIGH (worst) — **FIXED (2026-07-19)**

- **Race (was):** `SampleRecorder::createNextCluster()` (audio thread, real-time capture — incremented `currentRecordClusterIndex` and **grew** `SampleStream::table_`, a `std::vector<SampleCluster>`) vs `SampleRecorder::cardRoutine()` → `writeOneCompletedCluster()` → `SampleStream::chunk_at()` (loader/fiber thread) on the **same `currentRecordClusterIndex` field and the same `table_` vector**. If `table_` reallocated on the audio thread while the fiber was mid-index into the old backing array → **use-after-free / OOB read**.
- **Fix:** `SampleStream::table_` is now a **stable-address `deluge::SegmentedVector`** (`src/deluge/util/segmented_vector.h`) whose elements never move on growth, so a grow can no longer move storage under a concurrent reader. The `currentRecordClusterIndex` hand-off is a **release/acquire `std::atomic`** (producer completion store ↔ fiber consumer loop-bound load), with the finalize ownership-flip carried by an atomic `status`.
- **Verified:** the `preemptive_race_tsan` harness under sustained record-while-stream reports **no** SUMMARY race on `createNextCluster` / `cardRoutine` / `writeCluster` / `chunk_at` / `entry`.

## B3 — record payload buffer: audio `copy_n` vs fiber `write(2)` — HIGH — **FIXED (2026-07-19)**

- **Race (was):** the audio thread's `std::copy_n` into the in-progress record cluster's buffer vs the fiber's `write(2)` (`deluge_bsp::sd::host::write_sectors`) of that **same buffer** — a torn/half-written buffer if the copy landed mid-write.
- **Root cause / fix:** **same as B2** — the recorder producer/consumer hand-off had no synchronization. The B2 release/acquire completion edge now orders the completed cluster's payload writes happens-before the fiber's write of that cluster (the fiber only drains clusters `< currentRecordClusterIndex`, which it acquires), so the fiber never reads a buffer the audio thread is still filling.
- **Verified:** no recorder-payload torn-write SUMMARY (`write` / `__tsan_memmove` traced to the recorder) appears in the harness. (Note: a bare `__tsan_memset`/`__tsan_memmove` SUMMARY still appears but traces to **B1**'s `Cell<ChunkSlot>` `mem::replace`, not the recorder — see `open_findings_races.txt`.)

---

## B4 — rung-5 priority queue: NORMAL-job starvation (no starvation-freedom guarantee) — RESOLVED (2026-08-04)

- **Where:** `src/bsp/rust/src/fiber.rs` `dequeue()` — strict HIGH-before-NORMAL priority (added in the async-SD rung-5 flip).
- **Symptom (demonstrated deterministically by Lens 1's zero-jitter clock):** `loader::request_pump`'s periodic HIGH-priority dispatch re-arms itself (~100–200 µs) strictly before any fallback, so with no timing jitter a HIGH job is *always* in the ring at every `dequeue`, and strict HIGH-before-NORMAL **starves every NORMAL job forever** — `LoadSongUI::performLoad`'s dispatched job never ran once.
- **On device:** real-hardware timing jitter opens a gap between `request_pump`'s completion and its re-arm during which a pending NORMAL job wins, so *total* starvation is practically unreachable — **but the policy has no starvation-freedom guarantee.** This is the "fairness edge" flagged in the rung-5 design.
- **RESOLVED (2026-08-04, commit 7188cef4c):** the entire HIGH-priority worker-ring tier was deleted — it had been inert since its only producer, `loader::request_pump`, died with `loader.cpp` (nothing set the ring's `is_high` bit). `dequeue()` is now a plain oldest-sequence FIFO with no priority levels, so HIGH-before-NORMAL starvation cannot occur and no aging backstop is needed. The Lens-1 fairness knob (`HIGH_PRIORITY_FAIRNESS_BOUND`) was removed with the tier.

## B5 — rung-5 priority queue: unsynchronized `Q_COUNT` / ring links — HIGH — **OPEN (new, 2026-07-19)**

- **Race:** `deluge_rust::fiber::enqueue` writes `deluge_rust::fiber::Q_COUNT` (and the two-level priority ring links) on the **audio thread** — via `loader::request_pump` → `Coalescer::request` → `deluge::storage::Owner::run_priority` → `deluge_worker_run_priority` → `fiber::enqueue` (a HIGH-priority loader-fill dispatch issued from the audio render path) — while the **fiber (owner) thread** reads `Q_COUNT` in `deluge_rust::fiber::queue_nonempty` / `dequeue`.
- **TSan site:** `src/bsp/rust/src/fiber.rs:470` (`enqueue`, write of `Q_COUNT`) vs `fiber.rs:662` (`queue_nonempty`, read). Global `deluge_rust::fiber::Q_COUNT`.
- **Root cause:** the **rung-5 two-level priority queue** (async-SD staging ladder) has no synchronization on its counters/links between an audio-thread HIGH enqueue and the fiber's queue check — same single-threaded-by-assumption class as B1. **Not introduced by the B2/B3 recorder fix** (which touched none of `fiber.rs` / `owner.cpp` / `loader.cpp`); surfaced here under preemptive audio + sustained streaming. Belongs to the async-SD ladder / preemptive-scheduler work, not the recorder.
- **UPDATE (2026-08-04, commit 7188cef4c):** the specific audio-thread trigger traced above — `request_pump` → `Owner::run_priority` → `deluge_worker_run_priority` → `enqueue` — was DELETED with the HIGH-priority tier, and the ring lost its two-level (`is_high`) links (`dequeue` is now plain FIFO). But this does NOT confirm the race closed: `Q_COUNT` still has no synchronization, and the recorder/card-init coalescers still reach `enqueue` from a non-fiber context (`requestRecorderCardRoutines`, on the audio routine, → `Owner::run_sd_routine` → `enqueue`, `audio_engine.cpp:1601`). Re-run the preemptive TSan harness to see whether the `Q_COUNT` race still reproduces via that path before marking resolved. The TSan line numbers above (`fiber.rs:470/662`) are now stale.

## Additional surfaced races — preemptive **streaming/playback** path (pre-existing, nondeterministic, out of scope)

The harness intermittently surfaces a broader set of preemptive-audio races on the **streaming/playback + loader + resource-manager + allocator** path — e.g. `deluge::audio::stream::loader::reconstruct_one`, `SampleStream::read_cluster_data`, `stitch_boundaries`, `StreamedChunk::payload()`, `deluge_resource_loader_next` (B1's Manager, at a different SUMMARY frame), and `deluge_alloc::tlsf::Tlsf::remove_free_block`. These are the audio render thread reading/loading a cluster while the loader fiber reconstructs it (and the shared allocator/manager underneath) — the **same single-threaded-by-assumption class as B1/B5**, applied to the *playback* side rather than the recorder.

They are **not introduced by this branch** (which touches only `sample_recorder.*`, `sample_stream.*` [container swap + `reserve`], and the new `segmented_vector.h` — none of `loader.cpp` / `stitch.cpp` / `cluster.h` / `manager.rs` / `tlsf.rs`), and they fire **nondeterministically**: e.g. one `BLOCKS=2000` run reported 7 uncatalogued while the next two reported 0. Consequently a run's `UNCATALOGUED=0` is **not guaranteed** and should not be read as "the storage path is race-free." The reliable, reproducible guarantee this branch establishes is narrower and specific: the **recorder hand-off races (B2/B3) never appear in any run** post-fix. The streaming-path races are catalogued neither in `known_patterns.txt` nor `open_findings_races.txt` (the catalog is incomplete for this surface) and remain **open, out of scope** — prerequisites, alongside B1/B4/B5, for the broader "make the whole storage path preemption-safe" work.

## Caveat — harness scenario stability at high `BLOCKS`

Under the extended `BLOCKS=8000` record-while-stream scenario, 2 of 5 runs reported `scenario=FAILED` (the run did not reach a clean completion — likely the `timeout 300` cap and/or B1/B5 corruption under sustained preemption). This does not affect the B2/B3 verification (the passing runs exercised many `createNextCluster` grows with the races gone, up to 294 completions — past the `SegmentedVector`'s 256-entry segment boundary — in a follow-up `BLOCKS=12000` repro that passed clean), but a shorter/tuned `BLOCKS` is advisable for a stable green run, and the failures are themselves circumstantial evidence that the remaining open races (B1/B5) can destabilize a long preemptive run.

**Re-verification note (2026-07-19, follow-up):** re-ran the `BLOCKS=8000` scenario directly (outside `run.sh`) under `gdb` with `TSAN_OPTIONS=handle_segv=0` to capture a full native backtrace of one of these crashes (the batch runs' own TSan-handled SEGV report was truncated — TSan's own signal handler produced no backtrace, only "SEGV on unknown address... caused by a WRITE"). The captured crash is **inside ThreadSanitizer's own runtime** (`__tsan::TraceSwitchPartImpl` / `__tsan::TraceRestartMemoryAccess`), triggered while instrumenting a `Cell<ChunkSlot>::get` access in `Manager::loader_next` (B1's hot read path, called every fiber poll) — not a wild-pointer write reachable from application code. This is consistent with a **ThreadSanitizer trace-buffer/shadow-memory limitation under very long, high-event-count runs combined with host memory pressure** (this host was running with ~20/30GB swap in use at the time) rather than new applicaton-level memory corruption; it does not, by itself, confirm the "B1/B5 corruption" hypothesis above, though it also does not rule it out (TSan's instrumentation could itself be destabilized by prior corruption). Reproduced at a rate of roughly 2-3 crashes per 7 attempts at `BLOCKS=8000` on this host; not reproduced at `BLOCKS=12000` in a single follow-up run, consistent with a rare/environmental trigger rather than a deterministic function of block count or table-segment growth. Treat as a harness/tooling robustness note (mind memory headroom for large `BLOCKS`×`NUM_RUNS` sweeps on memory-constrained hosts), not a new confirmed application bug.

---

## Note: a harness-instrument gap (found and already FIXED)

Not a production bug, recorded for context: the harness's own `loaded`-miss underrun instrument initially missed `SampleLowLevelReader::moveOnToNextCluster` — the *common* sustained-streaming miss site — so it under-reported (couldn't fire underrun at all at first). Fixed in `fb0dc5e3a` (added the guarded counter there). This is why the negative control (proving the instrument *can* detect underrun) matters.

---

*This record was produced from the streaming-underrun harness's findings. The fuller per-finding writeups + both racing stacks live in the harness's `open_findings_races.txt` (committed) and the (local) task reports. **B2 + B3 are fixed** (2026-07-19, recorder hand-off: stable-address `SegmentedVector` + release/acquire atomics); **B1, B4, B5 remain open** and are the prerequisites still owed before shipping preemptive audio with SD record-while-stream.*

## B6 — `CLUSTER_LOAD_IMMEDIATELY` performs card transfers off the storage owner — HIGH — **FIXED in software (SP-stream-read Phase 1 + file-load rung, 2026-07-22); device runtime gate pending**

- **Fix (2026-07-22) — software-complete, four patterns:** All B6 chains now run their cold-cache load on the
  storage worker (`Owner::run`/`run_or_inline`), never blocking the executor. **Phase 1** (streaming +
  sample-browser): `on_owner()`/`run_or_inline()` (`f5fb6a6e9`); marker/clip-shift → `CLUSTER_ENQUEUE`
  (`f213e52d5`); pitch + Synth/Kit context-menu (`0cf05d0ba`). **File-load rung** (the 7 `AudioFileHolder::
  loadFile` chains): preset browser coalesced+snapshot (`5de611744`+`e419eedce`, UAF fix), Slicer preview
  (`dca8c364f`), ClearSong (`da9882d6a`), Slicer doSlice (`25122328d`), Drum Randomizer (`36cf330a8`),
  Undo/Redo (`668490235`). Two reusable safety patterns emerged and were applied per site: **snapshot-isolation**
  (target carries file identity by value; the op never reads live UI state across the SD-yield — fixes the UAF
  class) and **mode-gating** (`currentUIMode` LOADING sentinel set before dispatch → `isUIModeWithinRange`
  no-ops BACK/repeat-input during the window — fixes the concurrent-input crash class). Verified: audit build
  (`cargo device --features storage-owner-audit`) links; static coverage confirms every chain dispatches; the
  residual `loadFile` calls all sit inside worker ops. **DEVICE RUNTIME GATE PENDING (Kate):** the `sd.rs:386`
  single-owner assert is a runtime `debug_assert!` in the Embassy image — exercise the full UI (preset scroll,
  Slicer preview/slice, undo/redo, clear-song, randomizer) under the audit build and require it silent. Neither
  the host sim nor the TSan harness drives these UI paths, so runtime silence can only be shown on device.
- **(historical) Fix status (2026-07-22):** The sample-*streaming* + sample-browser call sites are FIXED on
  `feat/rustfs-sp1b-cached-chain` (SP-stream-read Phase 1, plan
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-21-sp-stream-read-phase1-ui-defer.md`): `Owner::on_owner()`/
  `run_or_inline()` added (commit `f5fb6a6e9`); marker-drag + clip-shift downgraded to `CLUSTER_ENQUEUE`
  (`f213e52d5`); pitch-detection + the Synth/Kit context-menu load ops dispatched onto the worker
  (`0cf05d0ba`, with the always-return-`true`+close-inside-op contract fix). Site 1 (waveform) was
  handled by 4460's background pre-scan (merged). **The `AudioFileHolder::loadFile` file-load family is
  NOT yet fixed — see the inventory below.**
- **⚠️ THE SITE LIST BELOW / in the SP-stream-read design §6 UNDER-COUNTED B6.** Task 4's coverage audit
  (`.superpowers/sdd/task-4-report.md`) found **seven more off-worker chains** into
  `AudioFileManager::getAudioFileFromFilename` → `buildAudioFileFromCard` → sites 6/7
  (`wave_table.cpp:422`, `cluster_byte_source.cpp:51`), all reaching a **cold-cache** FatFS load
  synchronously from a UI/model handler with no worker dispatch above them (all would trip the
  `sd.rs:386` audit on a cold hit once the owner is up):
  1. `slicer.cpp:411` — `Slicer::preview` (pad-hold audition). Clean-ish (same-function load+sound reorder).
  2. `slicer.cpp:524,646` — `Slicer::doSlice` (SELECT_ENC). Needs post-op-loop restructure.
  3. `consequence_audio_clip_set_sample.cpp:54` — Undo/Redo of "set sample on Audio Clip", via
     `PlaybackHandler::slowRoutine`. Clean whole-`undo()/redo()` dispatch.
  4. `load_instrument_preset_ui.cpp:879,1012` — preset auto-load on `currentFileChanged`. **HIGHEST
     TRAFFIC — fires on every non-reload encoder tick scrolling Load Synth/Kit.** Reads
     `currentInstrumentLoadError` synchronously → same fire-and-forget contract problem as Synth/Kit;
     the right fix likely involves coalesce-on-scroll (cf. `SampleBrowser::previewCoalescer_`), a UX
     design question.
  5. `clear_song.cpp:104,91` — `ClearSong::acceptCurrentOption` "Create New Song". Same
     `ContextMenu::buttonAction` bool-consumption Task 3 solved for Synth/Kit — apply the same pattern
     to a third subclass.
  6. `instrument_clip_view.cpp:2141` — Drum Randomizer pad gesture. Low-traffic, feature-gated.
- **→ These seven are their own rung: the `AudioFileHolder::loadFile` file-load path.** They share one
  root — a UI/model site triggers a *cold* `getAudioFileFromFilename` synchronously and needs the loaded
  file back — which is the `ui-storage-decoupling-northstar` leak. There is one choke point
  (`buildAudioFileFromCard`) but a naive dispatch there can't be fire-and-forget (callers need the
  result). Worth ONE design pass (choke-point vs call-site; coalesce-on-scroll UX), not seven ad-hoc
  wraps. Not folded into Phase 1 (decision, Kate, 2026-07-22).

### Original discovery record (2026-07-21) — kept for the trace

**Note:** this section's site list is the sample-streaming subset; the file-load family above was found later.


- **Where:** `SampleStream::get_cluster` (`src/deluge/storage/audio/stream/sample_stream.cpp:316-346`) →
  `deluge_resource_acquire` → `cluster_materialize` (`:42-58`) → `read_cluster_data` (`:180-254`) →
  `StreamReadSource` → `deluge_stream_read_at` → `deluge_block_read`. **This whole chain runs
  synchronously in whatever context called `get_cluster`, with no fiber dispatch anywhere in it.**
- **Contrast with the path that gets it right:** `loader::request_pump` (`loader.cpp:169-192`) is
  fiber-aware by construction — if not already `deluge_storage_on_owner()` it dispatches via
  `Coalescer`/`Owner::run_priority`, otherwise it runs inline. `CLUSTER_LOAD_IMMEDIATELY` bypasses that
  machinery entirely.
- **Off-fiber callers found** (traced 2026-07-21; none wrapped in `deluge::storage::Owner::run`):
  `waveform_renderer.cpp:404,433` (UI waveform redraw — slicer, marker editor, audio-clip view, browser,
  instrument-clip view); `sample.cpp:1395,1420` via `sample_browser.cpp:1369,1578,1589`
  (`loadAllSamplesInFolder`, bulk import); `sample_holder_for_voice.cpp:139` via
  `sample_browser.cpp:1025,1799` (`claimCurrentFile`); `sample_marker_editor.cpp:200` (marker drag);
  `audio_clip.cpp:1396` (`shiftHorizontally`).
  **Reached from BOTH contexts** (the dangerous case): `wave_table.cpp:422` and
  `cluster_byte_source.cpp:51`, both inside the general `AudioFile::load` /`buildAudioFileFromCard`
  pipeline, which is entered on-fiber for song load/preview and off-fiber for the UI paths above.
- **Confirmed NOT affected:** the RT audio render path never loads synchronously —
  `sample_low_level_reader.cpp:310,400`, `voice_sample.cpp:207,868`, `time_stretcher.cpp:1141` all use
  `CLUSTER_ENQUEUE`. `audio_engine.cpp:1391` (`previewSample`) *is* on-fiber: its only caller is
  `sample_browser.cpp:596`, dispatched via `Owner::run` at `:551/564`.
- **Why it goes unnoticed:** `src/bsp/rust/src/sd.rs:386-390` carries exactly the assert that would catch
  this — `debug_assert!(on_fiber() || !worker_started())`, "FatFS card transfer off the storage owner
  after the owner started — single-owner discipline violated at runtime" — but it is
  `#[cfg(feature = "storage-owner-audit")]`, and that feature is **not** in `default`
  (`src/bsp/rust/Cargo.toml:117` = `["rtt", "async_streaming_loader"]`). Meanwhile the transfer still
  *works*: `sd.rs:398` falls back to a parking `block_on` when off-fiber. That fallback is documented as
  being for the **boot mount**, valid only "before the owner is up".
- **Impact:** C FatFS is **not re-entrant**, which is the entire reason the single-owner discipline
  exists. A UI-thread synchronous card transfer concurrent with a fiber-side FatFS op is the corruption
  case the ladder was built to prevent. Also a latency hazard: these parks block the UI thread for a
  full SD transfer.
- **Reachability caveat (do not overstate):** the off-fiber call sites are *proven*; an actual concurrent
  FatFS entry has **not** been demonstrated. The bug is that the discipline is unenforced on this path,
  not that a specific corruption has been observed. A first repro step is to enable
  `storage-owner-audit` and exercise the waveform renderer or marker editor.
- **Fix (designed, not implemented):** give `get_cluster`'s synchronous-acquire path the same on-fiber
  dispatch `request_pump` already has — one location, structural, so the property holds for callers that
  do not know about it. Tracked as the prerequisite step of SP-stream-read
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-sp-stream-read-completion-design.md (local — docs/superpowers is gitignored)` §6); that rung **requires** it, because once the
  cluster→sector map is deleted there is no non-fiber fallback left.

## B7 — efatfs block device bypasses `SD_BUS` arbitration — HIGH — **FIXED (2026-07-21)**

- **Fix:** `SdBlockDevice::read`/`write` now call `crate::sd::locked_read_sectors`/`locked_write_sectors`,
  taking `SD_BUS` for the whole transfer exactly as the C-FatFS path does. Lock order is FS → SD_BUS
  (this impl runs under the efatfs FS mutex); nothing takes SD_BUS then FS, so no inversion. A comment
  guard above the `impl` records why the raw driver calls must never come back.
  **Still NEEDS-HARDWARE:** the interleaving was inferred from source, and the fix is verified by build +
  inspection only — there is no host test, since `fat_block_device.rs` is `cfg(target_os = "none")`.
- **Where:** `src/bsp/rust/src/fat_block_device.rs:64,78` — `SdBlockDevice::read`/`write` call
  `deluge_bsp::sd::read_sectors`/`write_sectors` **directly**, not `crate::sd::locked_read_sectors`
  /`locked_write_sectors`. The efatfs path therefore **never acquires `SD_BUS`**.
- **Why `SD_BUS` exists** (`src/bsp/rust/src/sd.rs:51-54`): `block_on_fiber` yields the executor
  *mid-DMA*, so without arbitration two contexts can drive the single SDHI controller concurrently. The
  C-FatFS path holds `SD_BUS` across its awaits (`sd.rs:197`, `:397`).
- **Impact:** a fiber-side C-FatFS transfer and an efatfs transfer can **interleave on the same SDHI
  controller**. Corrupt reads, corrupt writes, or a wedged controller. Note the two filesystems coexist by
  design during the migration, so this is reachable whenever both are in use.
- **Status:** live **only when `efatfs_streaming` is enabled** (not a default feature,
  `src/bsp/rust/Cargo.toml:117`). It was recorded as an SP1 carry-forward ("SdBlockDevice must go through
  SD_BUS arbitration (currently bypasses)") and never actioned.
- **⚠️ BLOCKED the SP-stream-read flag flip** — now unblocked by the fix above. `efatfs_streaming` must
  not have become a default feature until this was fixed, because the flip is precisely what makes it
  reachable in shipped builds.
- **Found by:** source analysis while verifying whether efatfs self-serialization removes the need for
  fiber dispatch (it does not — see B6 and
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-sp-stream-read-completion-design.md (local — docs/superpowers is gitignored)` §6). Inferred from source; not observed on
  hardware.

## Note: R1 (efatfs read-path timing change) Lens 2 run surfaced 18 more pre-existing signatures — cataloged, 0 R1-introduced (2026-07-22)

A `preemptive_race_tsan` sweep run against the R1 migration (the efatfs streaming-read path
picking up cached-chain seeking) surfaced 18 TSan `SUMMARY` signatures not yet in
`known_patterns.txt`/`open_findings_races.txt` (17 concentrated in one bursty run, 1 in
another). Full-stack attribution of all 18 found **zero** connection to R1: none of the
racing stacks contain an `efatfs`/`read_cluster_data`/`EfatfsReadSource`/
`block_on_fiber`-from-read/`ProdOps::read`/`sector_of`-FAT-walk frame. They fall into three
already-understood pre-existing classes:

- **TLSF allocator** (`crates/deluge_alloc/src/tlsf.rs:269,276,277,314,317,348,68,92` plus the
  generic `core::ptr::read`/`write::<*mut BlockHeader>` monomorphizations) — audio-thread voice
  allocation racing recorder cluster-table growth in the shared heap. Same single-threaded-by-
  assumption class as B1/B5, one level lower (the allocator underneath the resource manager).
- **Playback/song-transport** (`clip.cpp:223,245`, `instrument_clip.cpp:704`,
  `note_row.cpp:2137`, `song.cpp:4002`, `playback_handler.h:223`) — audio-thread tick
  (`processCurrentPos` / clock-active check) vs. (re)`setupPlayback` writes. Same class as the
  existing `playback_handler.cpp`/`arrangement.cpp` entries in `known_patterns.txt`.
- **AudioEngine global flags** (`audio_recorder.cpp:154` `bypassCulling`,
  `waveform_renderer.cpp:694` `audioRoutineLocked`) — same class as the `audio_engine.cpp`
  pattern already in `known_patterns.txt`, in two different files.

Cataloged in `known_patterns.txt` under its own dated header, pinned per-site (file+line+
function, not a bare file wildcard) rather than folded into the broader existing patterns —
deliberately, so a genuinely new race at a different line in these frequently-touched files
still surfaces as `UNCATALOGUED`. Verified deterministically against the saved
`preemptive_race_tsan/logs/run_{1..5}.log`: 18 uncatalogued → 0 uncatalogued after the catalog
update, replaying `run.sh`'s own normalize+classify logic. Recorded, not suppressed — see
`known_patterns.txt`'s header for why patterns over exact-line matching.

## B8 — concurrent clip-delete frees the AudioClip an in-flight audio-clip-sample revert is mid-load on — HIGH — **OPEN (pre-existing, found 2026-07-22)**

- **Where:** `ConsequenceAudioClipSetSample::revert` (`src/deluge/model/consequence/consequence_audio_clip_set_sample.cpp:54`) loads a sample (`AudioFileHolder::loadFile`) which YIELDS on SD I/O. During that yield a concurrent "delete this clip" gesture can free the `AudioClip` the revert is operating on → use-after-free.
- **Pre-existing, NOT introduced by the file-load rung (B6 #6):** `loader::pump()` already calls `playbackHandler.slowRoutine()` on the worker when `may_process_user_actions` is true (`loader.cpp:98-99,116-117`, SP1a/rung-5 infrastructure). So on Embassy the undo/redo revert already runs from the worker with a yielding load, and the clip-free window already exists. The B6 #6 change (commit `668490235`) only makes the *main-tick* path consistent (also on the worker); it does not create this window.
- **Reachability caveat:** found by source analysis while doing B6 #6; not observed. The `Action`/`Consequence` chain is unlinked from the undo/redo lists during the op (so the *consequence* isn't freed), but the `AudioClip` it references is a separate object that a clip-delete can free.
- **Fix (future ticket):** protect the target `AudioClip` for the revert-load duration (pin it / gate clip-delete during the op / snapshot-and-revalidate), or move to the model-ownership boundary where the clip's lifetime is owned by the storage domain for the op. Its own concern, not the file-load rung's.
