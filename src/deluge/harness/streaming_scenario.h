/// @brief Host-only C-ABI bridge for the streaming-underrun harness (the Rust/Embassy
///        `host_app` BSP, `src/bsp/rust/src/scenario.rs`).
///
/// Lets the harness drive a REAL song load, REAL playback, and a REAL concurrent output
/// recording headlessly — the exact application entry points a user's LOAD/PLAY/RECORD
/// button presses reach (LoadSongUI, PlaybackHandler, AudioRecorder), minus the button/HID
/// layer. None of it changes their behaviour; every function is a thin, direct call into
/// (or dispatch onto the storage owner of) existing production code.
///
/// @note `DELUGE_HOST`-only (see sim/CMakeLists.txt's `add_compile_definitions(DELUGE_HOST)`):
///       compiled into every x86 build off this tree (deluge_host/deluge_render/deluge_loadcheck,
///       and the Rust Embassy `host_app`), never into the ARM device firmware. Unreachable —
///       and so behaviourally inert — from deluge_host/deluge_render/deluge_loadcheck's own
///       drivers; only the Rust harness calls these.
///
/// ## Why two-phase song load
/// On the Embassy BSP, `Browser::beginListing` (which `openUI(&loadSongUI)` triggers)
/// dispatches the directory listing onto the single storage-owner fiber ASYNCHRONOUSLY —
/// unlike the legacy/cooperative host_bsp (`host_render_main.cpp`'s `deluge_render_driver`),
/// where every `Owner::run` dispatch happens to run inline. So the harness must poll for the
/// listing to finish before committing the load, exactly as a real LOAD-button UI flow does
/// (open browser → listing completes asynchronously → user presses LOAD → the load itself
/// dispatches as a SEPARATE fiber job). See `deluge_scenario_begin_song_load` /
/// `deluge_scenario_song_listing_in_progress` / `deluge_scenario_commit_song_load` below.
