//! Storage-generic, host-testable core of the embedded-fatfs streaming read
//! path (SP1a Task 7a). This module holds the load-bearing logic — the
//! file-handle table, the `FileContext` detach/reattach, the generation guard,
//! and the fill loop — with NO device dependencies: it is generic over the
//! embedded-fatfs `FileSystem`'s IO type, uses no `static`s, no fibers, and no
//! `SdBlockDevice`, so a host test (and the `lens1_vt_sim` margin harness) can
//! drive the exact same code over a host/sim block device.
//!
//! `efatfs_fs.rs` (device-only) wraps this: it owns the mounted `FileSystem`
//! and the `HandleTable` behind two async `Mutex`es and composes the SPLIT
//! primitives below ([`HandleTable::checkout`] / [`read_context`] /
//! [`HandleTable::commit`]) under its lock discipline — HANDLES is cloned-out
//! and released BEFORE the FS mutex is taken, then re-taken to write back.
//! Holding the table borrow across the FS await (as a monolithic `&mut self`
//! op would) is what [`HandleTable::read_at_owned`] does for single-threaded
//! host/sim callers; the device path must NOT use it, or it would invert the
//! FS→HANDLES order `open` takes and deadlock.
//!
//! Handle model: the streaming read path opens each sample once, detaches it to
//! a [`FileContext`] (cheap to `Clone`, carries `current_cluster` so forward
//! reads skip re-walking the cluster chain), and re-attaches a fresh `File`
//! from that context on every read. No per-op heap allocation.

// used to carry (`EfatfsLocator`/`open_by_locator`/`readdir_locator`): the UI
// identifies files by path, not by a locator handle, so the locator machinery
// was a premature optimization with no consumer. `DirCursor` entries are now
// plain `DirEntryInfo`, no `Option<EfatfsLocator>` half.
