/// libdeluge/streaming_fill.h — the cluster-fill descriptor + resource-manager/asset C-ABI.

/// The Rust async fill task (deluge-bsp-rust's `streaming_loader.rs`, over `deluge_sample_fill`'s
/// `native_begin`/`native_finish`) resolves each queued chunk's read geometry into a
/// `StreamingFillDescriptor`, performs the read, then converts/stitches/publishes. This header
/// carries the shared FFI types (the descriptor) plus the resource-manager/asset and
/// signal/readiness entry points that cross the C++/Rust boundary. The async task calls
/// `native_begin`/`native_finish` directly.
