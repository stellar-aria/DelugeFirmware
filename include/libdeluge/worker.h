/// libdeluge/worker.h — run a long, cooperatively-yielding operation off the
/// caller's stack.
///
/// Some user-initiated operations (song load, stem export, grid clip create) run
/// for a long time and `yield()` (scheduler_api.h) partway through to let other
/// work proceed. On a runtime where the caller's context cannot itself suspend
/// (e.g. the Embassy BSP, where the operation is dispatched from a task that must
/// stay responsive), hand the operation to the worker: it runs on a dedicated
/// stackful fiber so its `yield()`s suspend the *operation*, not the caller.
///
/// `deluge_worker_run` returns immediately (the operation is queued); the launching
/// handler must therefore include any post-operation work *inside* `fn`.
