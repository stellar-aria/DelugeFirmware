//! `audio_io.h` — host null-sink render pump for the `host_app` feature.
//!
//! On device (`audio.rs`) `deluge_audio_drive` trickles the app's render into
//! the SSI TX DMA ring, paced by the free-running play head. There is no DMA
//! (or any audio device at all) on host: this module instead makes the
//! priority-0 C++ task (`AudioEngine::routine_task`, spawned by
//! `registerTasks()` during `deluge_app_init` — see `scheduler.rs`'s
//! `addRepeatingTask`) actually call `deluge_app_render` each time it drives,
//! discarding the output block (a null sink), so the render graph exercises
//! for real instead of the no-op stub in `host_link_stubs.rs`.
//!
//! A second, preemptive host executor thread (`"deluge-audio"`, spawned in
//! `main.rs`'s `host_app` boot path) is what `scheduler::set_audio_spawner`
//! routes the priority-0 task onto — the host analogue of device `audio.rs`'s
//! `AUDIO_EXEC` SGI executor. `AudioEngine::runRoutine()` (audio_engine.cpp) also
//! calls `routine()` — and so `deluge_audio_drive` — directly and synchronously
//! from `deluge_boot()`, before `registerTasks()` assigns `routine_task_id`
//! ("necessary otherwise Deluge freezes on boot"); that one pre-registration call
//! runs on whichever thread called `deluge_boot` (the host-app executor thread),
//! not `"deluge-audio"` — expected, and `deluge_audio_drive` below accounts for
//! it rather than treating it as a routing failure. Once `registerTasks()`
//! returns, every subsequent call is driven by the scheduled task and runs on
//! `"deluge-audio"`. No ISR and no other task touches this module's state
//! concurrently with a render *from the same thread*, but the render itself can
//! now run concurrently with everything else — the `static mut` buffer access is
//! no longer single-threaded in the way `audio.rs` documents for its own
//! statics; that's this module's whole point.
