//! Device `block_device_driver::BlockDevice<512>` over the real SD driver
//! (`deluge_bsp::sd`) — the on-device sibling of `fs_differential`'s host
//! `FileBlockDevice` (`fs_differential/src/block_dev.rs`), which mirrors this
//! shape over a file-backed `RamDisk` instead. Both feed the same
//! `BufStream`/`embedded-fatfs` stack (`crates/block-device-driver`,
//! `crates/block-device-adapters`) SP1 is bringing up on-device.
//!
//! Unlike the host adapter, `type Error` here is `deluge_bsp::sd::SdError`,
//! not `core::convert::Infallible`: `sd::read_sectors`/`write_sectors` talk to
//! real SDHI hardware over DMA and can genuinely fail (card removed, protocol
//! error, DMA timeout, …). `Infallible` would make that failure
//! un-representable at the `BlockDevice` boundary; propagating `SdError`
//! keeps a real I/O error visible to `embedded-fatfs` instead of silently
//! discarding it (or panicking, `Infallible`'s only other option under a
//! `Result` that must never be `Err`).
//!
//! Device-only: the real `sd` driver only exists under `target_os = "none"`
//! (see `deluge_bsp::sd`'s module doc — its host stand-in is a file-backed
//! image, already exercised by `fs_differential`, so there is nothing new to
//! adapt on host).
