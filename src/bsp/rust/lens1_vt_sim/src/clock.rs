//! [`PeekableMockDriver`]: the deterministic virtual clock behind this
//! crate's discrete-event executor loop (advance to the next timer deadline,
//! poll to quiescence, repeat).
//!
//! `embassy_time::MockDriver` (the `mock-driver` feature's shipped type)
//! exposes `advance(Duration)` and `now()`/`get()` but no "what's the next
//! scheduled deadline" accessor: its internal `next_expiration` both peeks
//! and fires in one call, and the return value is never surfaced. Jumping
//! straight to the next due timer instead of stepping tick-by-tick needs
//! that peek, hence [`PeekableMockDriver`] — an independent implementation
//! of the same `embassy_time_driver::Driver` trait with the peek added.
//!
//! Kept as a copy rather than shared as a library: this file is byte-identical
//! to the one in the sibling harness package (`golden_vt_render`),
//! duplicated so each package stays self-contained. Keep the two in sync.
