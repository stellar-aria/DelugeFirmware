//! U1 Task 5 — the reader differential, the rung's gate: drives `deluge_sample_reader`'s
//! `open`/`window`/`advance`/`deluge_sample_read` over REAL, constructed streamed chunks (a real
//! `deluge_resource` manager, a synthetic sample whose converted cluster bytes are KNOWN) and asserts
//! the bytes it returns are BYTE-IDENTICAL to a direct read of each chunk's own resident payload
//! buffer (this file's own oracle, [`oracle_frame`]) at the location this crate's independently
//! reimplemented frame -> (cluster, byte-offset) arithmetic ([`mapping`]) computes.
//!
//! ## Why this is a genuine, non-vacuous cross-check
//!
//! [`mapping`] (this crate's `src/mapping.rs`) is an INDEPENDENT reimplementation of the
//! frame -> (cluster, byte-offset) arithmetic, kept deliberately separate from
//! `deluge_sample_reader::reader`'s own (private) `locate`/`Geometry` — see that module's own doc.
//! [`oracle_frame`] fetches its bytes straight from a chunk's own resident payload buffer (through
//! `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload`), addressed using this crate's OWN
//! mapping — never through the reader under test. The reader resolves clusters and offsets through
//! its OWN (different) code path (`Reader::window`'s `locate`/`acquire_and_fill`/the self-pin). If
//! either side's arithmetic — or the reader's straddle/stitch handling — diverges, the byte
//! comparison below catches it directly, not a hand-derived approximation of it.
//!
//! Every cluster's trailing 7-byte slack (the straddle mechanism both the reader and this file's
//! oracle rely on) is published by the REAL `deluge_sample_fill::native_finish` — the SAME stitch
//! (`deluge_sample_convert::stitch_boundaries`) production fills use — so a straddling frame's oracle
//! bytes are the real stitched bytes, not hand-seeded ones (see [`ChunkHarness::new`]).
//!
//! **U4d note.** Before U4d, this file's oracle instead read through the real, unmodified C++
//! `StreamedChunk::frame_read_origin`/`payload_with_trailing_slack()` (`storage/cluster/cluster.h`,
//! via a `cc`-compiled shim, `cpp/harness_shim.cpp`) — an extra proof that the byte-copy oracle
//! below agreed with the actual production accessor, not just with itself
//! (`direct_oracle_matches_frame_read_origin_oracle`, since deleted). U4d relocated the streamed
//! chunk's storage into Rust and deleted `frame_read_origin` for the streamed SAMPLE role entirely
//! (it survives only on the unrelated `ComputedChunk`/SampleCache role, `storage/cluster/cluster.h`)
//! — so that self-consistency proof no longer has a production function to check against, and was
//! retired along with the C++ shim and its `region_read_diff_frame_via_origin` entry point (U4d
//! Task 3). [`oracle_frame`] itself is unchanged in substance: `payload_with_trailing_slack()` was
//! always just "the payload pointer, `cluster_size + 7` bytes" — expressed directly here now,
//! through the same `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload` accessor the reader itself uses, with no C++
//! involved at all.
//!
//! ## The synthetic sample
//!
//! Every case builds a fresh [`ChunkHarness`]: a real `deluge_resource` manager (slab-backed, the
//! same backing kind production streaming clusters use) over a real heap, with `N` real streamed
//! chunks constructed via `deluge_resource_request` (never payload == backing — the SR2d-4 lesson
//! `deluge_sample_reader`'s own tests already flag; payload is always reached through the real
//! `deluge_sample_fill::chunk::payload` accessor). Each cluster's own `cluster_size` bytes are seeded
//! with a deterministic, per-cluster-index ramp (`region_read_differential::ramp`), then EVERY
//! cluster is `native_finish`ed, in increasing index order, so the REAL stitch
//! (`deluge_sample_convert::stitch_boundaries`, via `deluge_sample_fill::native_finish`) publishes
//! each cluster's own head into its predecessor's trailing 7-byte slack — the exact mechanism
//! `Reader::window`'s own straddle handling relies on (see its doc). Every geometry here uses
//! `RawDataFormat::Native` (0), so the convert step is a no-op and the seeded ramp survives into the
//! resident payload unchanged, and `audio_data_start_bytes == 0`, so [`mapping::Geometry::total_frames`]'s
//! simple "frame's whole span fits in `[0, audio_data_length_bytes)`" EOF rule holds exactly (see its
//! own doc). All `N` clusters are pre-filled before any reader is opened, so `deluge_efatfs_read_at`
//! (this file's own stub, always failing) is never actually exercised except by the ONE dedicated
//! forced-failure case, which deliberately leaves its cluster unconstructed.
