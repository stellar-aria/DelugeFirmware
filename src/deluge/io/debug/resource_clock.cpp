/// @brief The clock the Rust resource manager measures loader service latency with.
///
/// `crates/deluge_resource` has no clock of its own and cannot reach the audio engine, so it declares
/// this and the app provides it. Output frames (the `AudioEngine::audioSampleTimer` unit), which is
/// the natural unit here: a 32 KB cluster is ~8192 frames of 44.1 kHz stereo 16-bit playback, so a
/// latency in frames is directly comparable to the budget it has to fit inside.
///
/// A plain 32-bit read, so it is atomic on this target even though the audio ISR writes the timer —
/// see the deadline-scheduling design for why the timer is deliberately NOT widened to 64 bits.
