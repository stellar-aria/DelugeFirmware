/// libdeluge/fault.h — what the crash reporter needs from the board.
///
/// The pad-grid crash pattern itself is portable and lives in the application
/// (`src/deluge/io/debug/fault_pattern.c`): it encodes each candidate return address
/// as 32 lit pads so a photograph of the panel can be decoded back into a
/// backtrace. Only two things about it are board-specific — how bytes reach the pad
/// driver, and which address ranges count as code or stack — and those are the hooks
/// below.
///
/// **Every hook here runs from a CPU fault vector**, with the scheduler dead, most
/// state untrustworthy and quite possibly a corrupted heap. They must therefore be
/// synchronous, allocation-free and interrupt-free: no async runtime, no waiting on
/// a task, no DMA completion interrupt. A hook that needs the hardware taken away
/// from a driver should simply take it — nothing is going to run afterwards.
