//! `region-fill-differential` — SR2d-4 Task 6, the rung's gate: proves the native Rust
//! `fill_logic::finish_convert_stitch` (SR2d-4 Task 5) is byte-identical to the C++ orchestration it
//! replaced (`finish_fill`, `storage/audio/stream/async_fill.cpp:110-162`) at the ORCHESTRATION level
//! — which bytes get converted, which neighbour edges get built from where, in what order — not just
//! the underlying convert/stitch primitives (`convert_cluster_data`/`stitch_boundaries`), which
//! `sample_convert`'s own suite already proved byte-identical against SIMDe (SR2d-2).
//!
//! Mirrors `region_differential`'s structure (SR2c/SR2d-3): a standalone Cargo crate (NOT a workspace
//! member — keeps this test-only harness off the firmware/BSP Cargo graph); `build.rs` `cc`-compiles a
//! C++ reference slice ([`cpp_ref`]) into the test binary; `tests/` holds the differential gate
//! (`tests/differential.rs`, including its non-vacuity/perturb case) and the host end-to-end pipeline
//! test (`tests/host_end_to_end.rs`).
//!
//! The Rust side under test, `fill_logic::finish_convert_stitch`, is NOT re-exported from here —
//! `deluge-bsp-rust` is bin-only (no `[lib]` target), so each test file pulls `src/fill_logic.rs` (and,
//! for the host end-to-end test, `src/fill_sidecar.rs`) in unmodified via `#[path]`, the same
//! convention `tests/fill_logic_host.rs`/`tests/fill_sidecar_host.rs` already use from INSIDE that
//! crate — this crate just does it from a sibling directory instead.
