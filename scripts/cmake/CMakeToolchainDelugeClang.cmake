# Clang variant of CMakeToolchainDeluge.cmake.
#
# Compiles the portable C++ application with clang for armv7a-none-eabihf while
# taking the entire C/C++ library stack (newlib, libstdc++, libsupc++, libgcc)
# from the bundled arm-none-eabi-gcc sysroot. Clang is only ever the front end;
# no clang runtime, no libc++, no picolibc.
#
# Why the sysroot rather than a self-contained clang: the GCC tree already ships
# a prebuilt NEON hard-float multilib (thumb/v7-a+simd/hard) matching this
# firmware's flags exactly, so clang-built objects link against the very same
# libraries GCC-built ones do.

# Architecture. Mirrors CMakeToolchainDeluge.cmake with one deliberate change:
# -mfpu=neon-fp16 rather than -mfpu=neon.
#
# LLVM's own cortex-a9 model enables +fp16 by default, so rustc has it on while
# clang's -mfpu=neon explicitly turns it OFF. That single difference makes the
# Rust callee's feature set a non-subset of the C++ caller's, and LLVM then
# refuses every cross-language inline — the whole point of the lld/LTO work.
# neon-fp16 also replaces a `bl __aeabi_h2f` call with one vcvtb.f32.f16, and
# selects the same thumb/v7-a+simd/hard multilib.
#
# Half-precision is a property of the Cortex-A9 core, not of Renesas' integration:
# the NEON MPE this part demonstrably has (existing builds run with -mfpu=neon)
# brings VFPv3 with the half-precision extension. Both toolchains agree
# independently — LLVM's cortex-a9 model enables +fp16 by default, and GCC's
# -mfpu=auto for -mcpu=cortex-a9 reports __ARM_FP=14 (half+single+double) where
# the explicit -mfpu=neon reports 12. So -mfpu=neon is subtracting a capability
# the CPU has, and neon-fp16 restores it.
